The pasty's are also amazing, I suggest that you share one unless you are feeding a college kid that loves leftovers, the portions are huge. Go NOW.

The place is very hipster, dark and packed. It definitely seems like a Sherlock holmes, batman night out. \n\nThere are days when I crave for their Mushroom soup. Its one of the best soup i have had. They have creamy, walnut filled mushroom soup, served with house made bread and heaps of butter. You will never get tired of their bread. Cream of tomato with croutons is good too. We generally order Tandoori wings for our appetizer, which is cooked to perfection, not spicy and served with celery and ranch. When it comes to pasty, they are the boss. Their Lamb vidaloo, Chicken tikka masala brings out the complete flavor in a pasty form. The filling is delicious and their pasty, so soft made of complete butter just melts in the mouth, baked till crisp golden from the outside . One can eat just the plain pasty and crave for more. Spicy Asiago chicken and chicken pot pie are our next options. Please save room for desert, each ones unique but Apple caramel pasty you will not be disappointed.\n\nThey have a wide range of options and this place is definitely heaven for vegans too. The service is really good and you will find a lot of young hip crowd. The price is definitely reasonable and a great place to hangout with groups. I will keep visiting this place.",

Because one of the times I've been, we discussed/showed a nonnative English speaker the differences between pah-sty and pay-sty. Quite the conversation that evening, and I will never think of them again the same way.\n\nI never knew that this place was a Must-Do until looking it up afterwards! The only thing the guys in my volleyball group said we were \"going to a place nearby [to Mitchell Park] for beer and food\". I love beer. And I love food after a few hours of sand volleyball. Score points for them getting me to Cornish Pasty Co!\n\nWe walk in and I'm definitely taken back to some hipster dives and British pubs I've been to in my time. While it was a little too dark for my liking, I get the hipster feel they're going for since that's the majority of people I've seen there. The service has been wonderful - cheerful gals who consistently ask if they can help in any way and know their stuff. \n\nThe beer list is small, and I like it! Within two weeks of my two visits, the beer menu had changed. There were a few breweries that hadn't changed, but the styles had. ALL THAT is what I call quality. Even better, the two servers were knowledgeable about the entire beer menu each time. They must do extreme taste-testing before the beer menu goes out [which I'd be totally jealous of!]. The food is even better - my fellow volleyballers love the soups, and we all agree on the pasty's. I love love the Bangers & Mash Pasty, and the Oggie looks delicious too. You just can't go wrong with them... unless they are sold out for the day. My next goal is to try their desserts which sound very appealing!",

If you're planning on staying a while to enjoy the brand new patio (with heaters and misters), I would recommend getting an extra large glass. 32 ounces of fun. \n\nNext, go ahead and get yourself a cup of one of their awesome soups. Personal favorite: Red Pepper. Spicy, fresh, and delicious. If soup isn't your thing, I would recommend the oven chips -- oven-cooked french fries with cracked pepper. Definitely add the jalapeno. \n\nFor the main course, obviously a pasty is the way to go. My favorites include The Mexican (spiced steak strips, eggs, potatoes, jalapenos), The Royale with Cheese (hamburger, french fries, grilled onions, bacon, cheddar/swiss blend), and the Chicken Pot Pie (chicken, carrots, red potato, green beans, celery). \n\nFinish your meal off with a class Cornish Pasty desert: The Banoffee Pie. Graham cracker crust, homemade caramel with bananas, and whipped cream... If you're not melting already you should get to a past shoppe ASAP. \n\n5/5 for incredible atmosphere, food, staff, and overall experience. HIGHLY recommend.",

My wife is a pasty expert since her mother (who has made pasty's all her life) comes from Ontonagon, in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, which is knows as pasty country. We both tried the \"original\" pasty which we both agreed it was true to the original. It was hot, and full of the expected ingredients. In addition to the original the have many other types of pasty's, from Greek, to Mexican, vegetarian, chicken, salmon, to name a few. We would have liked to try some other styles of pasty, and will do so on our next visit to the Tempe area.  In addition to the pasty I did try a cup of one of the soups. The Cream of Leek, Potato and Stilton soup was to die for. A bowl of this soup could have been a meal in itself. Beer choices were very good, and they do have a happy hour 3-6 and all day Sunday with $1 off all beers.",

            "text": "Apparently hailing from the British city of Cornwall and here in Arizona finding its foothold at the appropriately named Cornish Pasty Company I had originally heard of the pasty during a recent trip to Philadelphia where the baked crescent was a daily special on the menu at The Dandelion but featuring the least the combination of beef, rutabaga, onion, and potato I cannot really say my interest as high - a situation remedied by the extensive (if inauthentic selection at Cornish Pasty Company and thus leading me through their doors just after 2:30pm where I'd find the small bar area still full but the larger dining room only perhaps half so.\n\nLargely unaware of the logistics of CPC - whether you seat yourself or wait to be seated and whether you order at the counter or at a table I stood and watched for a moment before deciding to seat myself and within moments a friendly young woman named Hannah greeted me, first offering a beverage - just water - and subsequently the restaurant's extensive menu which I browsed at length while listening to The Sex Pistols and then The Clash play overhead.  An eclectic list of Pasty's both 'traditional,' 'signature,' and 'premium' plus a collection of soups, salads, and sides I asked Hannah about portions on her return and told that each pasty clocked in at approximately a pound (and that two would be \"way too much\" food for a solo diner since she could only eat half of one) thus leading me to settle on a single option, a dish I was told would take \"about fifteen minutes,\" leaving me more time to study and enjoy the tunes - the White Stripes perhaps the only thing 'un-British' in a string of songs ranging from Zeppelin to The Beatles to The Ramones.\n\nReading as I waited and enjoying the room as well as watching the team slice meat, shape dough, and chop vegetables it would be just under a quarter hour before my dish arrived and although smaller than I'd imagined (I definitely could have eaten two - probably three if I didn't have dessert and dinner plans) the Shepherd's Pie that was presented was far better than I'd have ever expected, a golden buttery shell wrapped around lightly mint tinged lamb and although fatty and intense nicely balanced by the vegetables.  Generally a fan of Shepherd's Pie, particularly when using a sharp cheddar, this handheld version would prove to be an exemplary take on the classic and the addition of a sidecar of onion and sage laden red wine gravy certainly did not hurt.\n\nDebating a second pasty as Hannah returned to check in on me (The Pilgrim sounds quite good) but subsequently turning my attention to the sweeter half of the menu I decided to not make the same mistake twice and inquiring as to which dessert she recommended I went with my gut and ordered two to arrive with a delay between them, the first \"Shirley Temple's Pudding,\" a $6 sticky toffee pudding served in a cast iron pot with a side of crème anglaise.  Rich and thick, a dark treacle just barely set at the center and almost a brownie consistency along the edges what really shined about this dish was the manner in which it worked with the crème, a thick but delicate sauce balancing out the intense sweetness of the pudding.\n\nMoving next to my second dessert, and for my tastes the better of the two, a goodly delay of fifteen minutes brought to the table Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding with vanilla ice cream - a truly unique spin on bread pudding made with what almost seemed to be cracker-thin pieces of bread juxtaposing a brandy tinged chocolate sauce and baked much like the sticky toffee pudding to be set at the edges yet dense and moist at the center.  Truly a decadent dessert - the sort begging for a glass of milk or coffee - I will say that the ice cream was rather run-of-the-mill vanilla and although it served its purpose admirably I'd definitely go with more anglaise on subsequent visits - visits which I'm sure will happen the next time I find myself drawn back to Tempe, or to Mesa where there is apparently a second location whose Banoffee Pie and Apple Caramel Pasties seem to be calling.",

I remember the first time we went after hearing about it here on Yelp, we ended up leaving with the 'ole \"where have you been my whole life\" feeling. This place is awesome. \n    The Cornish Pasty is located on the side of a very random and small strip mall, if you didn't know you were looking for it you would probably not even notice it. It is small on the inside, a narrow straight corridor with, I believe, nine table, most of them two seaters, and while it has no big budget decorations, it is completely inviting and welcoming. It just feels right inside, a combination of old mining photos and 1940's country, a bare floor and a huge bar with completely open kitchen area to chat with the cooks while imbibing. We have consistently had great service when eating here, the waiters and waitresses are always very friendly and talkative, it's a fun place to be. \nThe food is top notch and super cheap, you can leave totally full and pay less than ten bucks, incredible. We have probably been here a couple dozen times and I have tried a large majority of the menu and have not found a pasty I didn't enjoy yet. Kristen's favorites are the Italian, which is pepperoni, salami, ham, mozzarella, basil and tomatoes with a marinara dipping sauce and the Pilgrim, which is turkey, sweet potatoes, grilled onions, stuffing and a red wine gravy, and I can attest, they are both delicious. My favorites are the Mexican, which is spiced steak strips, potatoes, eggs, hatch chilies and cheddar with a side of sour cream and the Shepard's Pie, which is lamb, peas, carrots, grilled onions, mashed potatoes and cheddar with a side of gravy, these are both like heaven in your mouth. And if you enjoy the occasional beer, Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar is my favorite and they have it on tap, they actually have a pretty good selection of brews. \n    If you have not tried the Cornish Pasty Company yet, you are doing yourself a great disservice, you can stop by today and get a cold beer a warm pasty and a full stomach for well under twenty bucks.

The best part is it isn't only the traditional meat cheese and potatoes. The options are all over the place and you can even bring your vegan friends. You can get a beer from the other side of the pond and the ambiance definitely feels like a good pub from across the Atlantic. \nThe only reason they aren't getting five stars is because my most recent visit; the bartender eating his dinner at the bar was clearly more important than my dinner. It's ok; it's not like with a hot meal I'd like to chase it down with a beverage of sort. The kitchen guys have always been extremely helpful and I appreciate them.

The Tempe location is tucked in the corner of a dingy mall far out of the Mill Ave nightlife.  There is barely a sign on the building, the windows are painted dark black with an old photo mural theme, the door leads into a narrow black corridor with no greeter.  It looks like a bar with a few 2-person tables and that's all ... until you accidentally discover that the bar (with barstools) is actually a \"kitchen\" with no alcohol and that if you wend your way around the end of the bar, passing the restrooms, you will find the actual dining room and drinking bar.  We ate in the kitchen/bar and only later happened upon that discovery and that there is second equally dark and foreboding door that goes to the main dining room.\n\nThe employees seemed to all guys, with a distinct aura of all being bikers, but they were super-friendly and acceptably attentive.  Assuming the food is made from scratch, the 20 - 30 minute wait to be served was also acceptable.  You can pass the time enjoying an excellent selection of draft and bottled beers.\n\nAt $6.50, my Oggie pasty was a good value.  The crust was tender and flakey and the meat was tasty.  I learned from this my first experience with rutabaga that I am not a fan of rutabaga, but that's not their fault. The amount of filling was roughly what you get in one of those tiny 99 cent pot pies in the frozen food section of the supermarket.  The brown-wine gravy was yummy.\n\nThe place sends a confusing message. It absolutely looks like a college dive (and I probably would be there all the time if I attended ASU) but it's quite a hike from campus. It's not Scottsdale funky (yea!!), and if you are wearing anything fancier than a tee shirt and jeans you would definitely feel out of place.  It's a curiously quiet place, none of the ribaldry you would find at an Irish pub (the canned music was mostly soft rock of the 70's and 80's).\n\nBottom line - it's rare to find a good pasty in this area, and these are good.  As the rating states, it's A-OK.",

I was looking for a place to grab some good food and a couple beers before a concert so I checked out Yelp and it did not lead me astray.\n\nTo me, a place like this is why Yelp needs to exist.  It was not in the most obvious location and when the group I was with went to walk in the front door we almost didn't know we were in the right place.  Let's just say their limited space is used very efficiently.  For what this place lacks in size, it makes up in character.\n\nInside it was kind of dark with some chairs lining the bar long the open kitchen and on the other wall a few small tables.  We found our spot in the back which was probably the only table big enough for 6 people.  The place was full and the noise level was just right; busy, but comfortable to have some lively dinner conversation. (Especially after some Irish Car Bombs.)\n\nTheir draft beer selection stuck to the UK theme with a lot of beers from that region.  I was especially surprised to see some Strongbow Cider.  They also had a few good micro brews from places like Firestone and Rogue.  Between that selection and the 32 oz. monster glasses they'd serve it in, this place was already a winner.\n\nMost importantly, their food was excellent.  I had the TIki Masala pasty and my wife had the Chicken Greek.  The Tiki Masala would be a great dish served by itself in an Indian restaurant.  Put it in a pasty and it's game over.  I tasted my wife's Chicken Greek which I probably wouldn't have picked as one of my own top choices to order and it was awesome.\n\nWe unanimously agreed this place was great and we had a laugh about some review around here that compared it to a Hot Pocket.  LOL.  I'll have to save that one under, \"Knowing about good food - FAIL!\"",

I remember the first time we went after hearing about it here on Yelp, we ended up leaving with the 'ole \"where have you been my whole life\" feeling. This place is awesome. \n    The Cornish Pasty is located on the side of a very random and small strip mall, if you didn't know you were looking for it you would probably not even notice it. It is small on the inside, a narrow straight corridor with, I believe, nine table, most of them two seaters, and while it has no big budget decorations, it is completely inviting and welcoming. It just feels right inside, a combination of old mining photos and 1940's country, a bare floor and a huge bar with completely open kitchen area to chat with the cooks while imbibing. We have consistently had great service when eating here, the waiters and waitresses are always very friendly and talkative, it's a fun place to be. \nThe food is top notch and super cheap, you can leave totally full and pay less than ten bucks, incredible. We have probably been here a couple dozen times and I have tried a large majority of the menu and have not found a pasty I didn't enjoy yet. Kristen's favorites are the Italian, which is pepperoni, salami, ham, mozzarella, basil and tomatoes with a marinara dipping sauce and the Pilgrim, which is turkey, sweet potatoes, grilled onions, stuffing and a red wine gravy, and I can attest, they are both delicious. My favorites are the Mexican, which is spiced steak strips, potatoes, eggs, hatch chilies and cheddar with a side of sour cream and the Shepard's Pie, which is lamb, peas, carrots, grilled onions, mashed potatoes and cheddar with a side of gravy, these are both like heaven in your mouth. And if you enjoy the occasional beer, Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar is my favorite and they have it on tap, they actually have a pretty good selection of brews. \n    If you have not tried the Cornish Pasty Company yet, you are doing yourself a great disservice, you can stop by today and get a cold beer a warm pasty and a full stomach for well under twenty bucks.

It wasn't overwhelmingly busy, and we sat down at a table. It took 20 minutes to even grab the attention of a server to order drinks. Our server came back with the wrong beers (really?) and then a different server greeted us (45 min. after sitting down) and we told her we were being helped by someone else. So the original server comes back with our beers and takes our food order - by the way, they do not have anything gluten free here, despite what other reviews say. The server said they don't ever have gluten free dough or anything. So that was a huge bummer, because my boyfriend literally couldn't get anything on the menu other than a salad. We finally got our food and it was fantastic (I got the chicken pot pie pasty).\n\nService was \"meh\" at best, food was great. 3 stars. I don't think we'll be going back to this location, though.",

The windows are blacked out with drapes, the ground is dark, the furnishing is dark, and with a tinge of yellow lighting throughout the place, you truly feel like you're in a medevil pub. \n\nThe menu is filled with a decent variety of classic, vegetarian, and modern/fusion pasties.  As a newcomer from out of town, it was quite hard for me to decide which pasty to get.  Although I really wanted to try one of the 2 portobello mushroom varieties, I ended up getting a classic, the cottage pie.  To fulfill my fungi craving, I paired it with a very garlicky, and very flavorful mushroom spinach soup.\n\nThe cottage pie was decent, but after the blast of flavor concentrated soup, my mouth was just not amazed by their spot on authentication, of the bland British classic.  If you want the classic, you'll probably love the nostalgia of the pie.\n\nIf you want flavor and the experience you get from lots of aromatic compounds, the Cajun chicken and Mexican pasty smelled wonderful.  \n\nI for one will be coming back for the balsamic portobello pasty next, which probably means tomorrow night since my trip here shall end the following day.

I'm cheap so spending $9+ on an entree with no sides seemed like it wouldn't be worth it - boy was I wrong. \nWe did have some difficulty trying to find the front door as its not right off the main road (Hardy) you have to go the parking lot and there you see a door with the business name and hours, which still didn't look like the right door. We walked in and felt like we came in a side door or something but a friendly gal said we could seat ourselves. \nThe place was pretty dark and looked like it had been there awhile which didn't bother us. We picked a two-top table which seemed like it was on a stage, we didn't want to take up the large community style (looking) tables.\nWe were promptly greeted by a sweet gal named Casey. She made us feel comfortable as we explained we hadn't been there before. My bf ordered a tea and they had three options (Hibiscus, black and green) he choose the green and said he liked it. I wanted an Odell Isolation but they said they ran out so I went with a Union Jack IPA (az local) and was pleasantly surprised by the price when we received our check that it was only $4, awesome deal! \nI normally eat vegan so I asked about the vegan pastie specials (two choices daily) They had quite a few vegan options on the menu (like 10) but all of them included a fake meat (Quorn brand) and I am not a fan of vegan food trying to be like \"normal\" food, just wanted veggies and nothing fake. She said one special was a \"Philly cheese steak style\" and the other was a spinach artichoke which sounded like what I wanted. My BF ordered the chicken pot pie one cause he knew that would be hard to mess up. He really enjoyed his, its what he was expecting - perfect and legit. \nMine arrived and I noticed mine looked different which I expected. I also noticed it had Daiya cheese on it which I wasn't expecting, I wish the server would have mentioned that cause I am not really a fan. To me Daiya has such a strong distinct flavor that it usually takes over whatever its on or in. This was no exception but I felt Like this time it was at least semi balanced where it didn't totally take it over but it was definitely a predominate taste. I know lots of vegans like that cheese but I'm a weirdo and would rather forgo fake cheese. \nHis crust was tasty since it had real butter and mine was a bit drier but still surprisingly good, even the boyfriend was stealing some from my plate.\nNext time I'm just gonna get a non vegan one so I can get the full experience, I really wanted to try a curry one (with no fake meat).\nOverall awesome experience and when u are there you feel like you are in a place of history, even if you are not - I am not sure ;)",

            "text": "Just fantastic. I first went to Cornish Pasty in 05' a few months after they opened and fell in love immediately. Although a few things have changed over the years each one is usually an improvement and never a negative. \n\nIf you are not familiar, a pasty is a traditional British coal miners food.  A hearty filling wrapped in a pie crust and baked. Kind of a hand-held meat pie. Cornish Pasty Co. has taken this simple and traditional dish and meticulously perfected each component. Their crusts are some how simultaneously hearty and flaky. Although their is nothing delicate about their seasoning it is never out of balance and all of the ingredients are always quality. \n\nBeyond just mastering the finer details of pasty science, Cornish Pasty Co. has also branched off into wild and exotic flavors. It's no shocker that the British know Indian food and it shows with the tika masala and the lamb vindaloo pasties. What is shocking is the refinement of the Greek and Italian inspired pasties. Perhaps my favorite pasty, from the cuisine most elusive to the British, is the Carne Avadado. This is a Mexican inspired pasty that will satisfy even the most snobby Las Cruses/El Paso foodie. If you have ever talked Mexican food with one you will know just what I mean. \n\nI have eaten nearly every item on the menu and not a one disappoints. It took me ages to get past the pasties and start ordering soups and salads. Now that I have had the spinach, mushroom, walnut soup, it is difficult to save room for my old favorites. \n\nAlthough the mine shaft inspired interior is dark and cramped I have never felt uncomfortable there. The sound system is usually bumping classic rock and the employees are pierced and tattooed well beyond your typical wait staff, but everyone is friendly and service is typically good.\n\nIf I have to list a negative the only one I can think of is the food is consistently just a little better at the University location than the Dobson one.  No clue why, but everyone I've talk to seems to agree, the Tempe store has the edge on quality.  \n\nAfter you add a respectable selection of beers the only reason you won't be here every night is your waist line.\n\n\nEdit (4/30/2014):\n\nFood's still good... but...  \n\nThe service has gone down hill. What was once a staff of edgy, unique, and skilled individuals. They are now mostly pretentious hipsters, with a bad attitude and below standard skills at basic service.",

The music they play is awesome and the workers are all really cool.\n\nThe food is awesomely comforting and filling. The amount of vegetarian pasties they offer is incredible.

They were crimped at one end so that the miners with the soiled hands could eat them and just throw out the end they were holding. Here the pasties range from $9-$11 each and the pictures on Yelp can be deceiving. You may think they look like a empanada but in real life they are the size of calzone, they are large. \n\nMushroom, Walnut, Spinach Soup - I'm a big cream of mushroom fan so I had to try this out. I ordered a full bowl but they only brought me out a cup of it. I asked if it was a mistake and they said they were out of the soup for the night so they gave me the smaller cup for free! After one sip I was wishing there was a bowl of it, because it was that good. Creamy mushroom without overdoing it on the cream, pureed spinach and walnuts with a walnut chunk in almost every bite. Served with warm sourdough bread. One of the best versions of mushroom soup that I have ever had.\n\nLamb & Mint Pasty (Lamb, Potatoes, Rutabaga, Onion, Fresh Mint) - My friends got this and I tried a bite. It was good, not gamey at all and paired well with the red wine gravy. Recommended. \n\nPeppered Steak Pasty (Sirloin Steak, Sautéed Portabella Mushrooms, Leeks, Roasted Zucchini, Stilton Cheese) - My server recommended this and it was all good until I forgot that it had Stilton in it. Stilton is a strong bleu cheese.  Don't get me wrong, this pasty was done very well... I would have liked it better if it didn't have Stilton in it but that was my bad for missing that on the description. If you enjoy steak and blue cheese, you will love this! Personal preference aside, this is a 5 star pasty.  It comes with a side of peppercorn brandy cream sauce which is delicious. This sauce is lightly sweet and creamy with pepper flavor but no heat and would be great with most of their pasties. If you can, ask for a side of this even if your pasty doesn't come with it. \n\nIf I make it back to Phoenix I'm going to have to try the Pilgrim (turkey, sweet potatoes and cranberry sauce), the Oogie (steak, potatoes, rutabaga), Shepard's Pie and Chicken Tikka Masala. The veggie offerings also look stupendous. \n\nThe only thing a Brit would find lacking is in their beer offerings. They do not carry too many brews from the UK. You can't get a Black and Tan or a Smithwicks here. Not a biggie, but just thought I'd mention it. \n\nUnexpected was the staff giving me the soup for free when I would have gladly paid for the smaller portion offering since I did order it. It was only a $4.50 difference, but Cornish Pasty Company went above and beyond to get it right, even when they didn't have to. \n\nNow if only they could figure out how to open other Cornish Pasty Companies across the nation (California please?)...",

Last night we went, around dinner rush. The place was packed and I didnt know it was a \"seat yourself\" establishment. Our server directed us all the way to the back where we shared a table with some other people. This place has a really cozy feel, its definitely not a restaurant fit for large groups of people. I went with my boyfriend and his brother. I got the Lovely Bit o' Salmon pasty, boyfriend got the Meat & Cheese, and his brother got the Cajun Chicken. We also ordered the oven chips. It took a bit to get our food, but I didn't really mind. When we finally got our order, it was well worth the wait. The Salmon pasty (filled with salmon, asparagus, red potatoes, tomatoes and spinach) was delicious.. especially that dill sauce it came with. The oven chips were amazing as well! My boyfriend and his brother absolutely loved their pasties as well. I even got to try the meat & cheese.. WOW. So good. I'm a sucker for anything cheesy! \n\nAtmosphere wise, the place is really laid back, I liked how a lot of the people there had tattoos and I didnt feel like myself or any of the people I was with were being judged..sometimes we get treated differently just based off the fact that we have tattoos at places which is a big bummer!

The best thing about the food is that it's not just one type of cuisine you're stuck with. There are options that are Italian, Mexican, Indian, British, and others so you have the option to try something new each visit. I'm also thankful that they have so many vegetarian choices, seeing how I've noticed that many restaurants in the Valley rely way too much on meat products. The atmosphere is also pretty cool too, there's no obnoxious fluorescent lighting or anything and it is pretty intimate (in a good way) as well as the fact that there's always great music playing thanks to the employees. Extra points for having a full bar :)",

Our server was Sarah who was absolutely wonderful. She was really on the ball, a great server, and anticipated our needs in advance. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Salad, my friend got the Porky pasty. Our food came in a rather timely fashion despite it being a very busy Friday dinner rush. I enjoyed the salad, the portion was huge. The chicken was tasty and there was plenty of tomatoes, cukes and dressing (on the side). My friend really enjoyed the Porky and even took some home, as it was quite a lot. I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical of this place when we first walked in. The darkness really didn't convey fun and friendly but the service was great and so was the food so it more than made up for the initial shock I felt upon arriving.

I remember the first time we went after hearing about it here on Yelp, we ended up leaving with the 'ole \"where have you been my whole life\" feeling. This place is awesome. \n    The Cornish Pasty is located on the side of a very random and small strip mall, if you didn't know you were looking for it you would probably not even notice it. It is small on the inside, a narrow straight corridor with, I believe, nine table, most of them two seaters, and while it has no big budget decorations, it is completely inviting and welcoming. It just feels right inside, a combination of old mining photos and 1940's country, a bare floor and a huge bar with completely open kitchen area to chat with the cooks while imbibing. We have consistently had great service when eating here, the waiters and waitresses are always very friendly and talkative, it's a fun place to be. \nThe food is top notch and super cheap, you can leave totally full and pay less than ten bucks, incredible. We have probably been here a couple dozen times and I have tried a large majority of the menu and have not found a pasty I didn't enjoy yet. Kristen's favorites are the Italian, which is pepperoni, salami, ham, mozzarella, basil and tomatoes with a marinara dipping sauce and the Pilgrim, which is turkey, sweet potatoes, grilled onions, stuffing and a red wine gravy, and I can attest, they are both delicious. My favorites are the Mexican, which is spiced steak strips, potatoes, eggs, hatch chilies and cheddar with a side of sour cream and the Shepard's Pie, which is lamb, peas, carrots, grilled onions, mashed potatoes and cheddar with a side of gravy, these are both like heaven in your mouth. And if you enjoy the occasional beer, Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar is my favorite and they have it on tap, they actually have a pretty good selection of brews. \n    If you have not tried the Cornish Pasty Company yet, you are doing yourself a great disservice, you can stop by today and get a cold beer a warm pasty and a full stomach for well under twenty bucks.

With an incredible beer selection, nice and friendly wait staff, and incredible food, the Pasty is one of my favorite places in Tempe, hands down. \n\nTo start, get yourself one of the many awesome beers they have on tap. If you're planning on staying a while to enjoy the brand new patio (with heaters and misters), I would recommend getting an extra large glass. 32 ounces of fun. \n\nNext, go ahead and get yourself a cup of one of their awesome soups. Personal favorite: Red Pepper. Spicy, fresh, and delicious. If soup isn't your thing, I would recommend the oven chips -- oven-cooked french fries with cracked pepper. Definitely add the jalapeno. \n\nFor the main course, obviously a pasty is the way to go. My favorites include The Mexican (spiced steak strips, eggs, potatoes, jalapenos), The Royale with Cheese (hamburger, french fries, grilled onions, bacon, cheddar/swiss blend), and the Chicken Pot Pie (chicken, carrots, red potato, green beans, celery). \n\nFinish your meal off with a class Cornish Pasty desert: The Banoffee Pie. Graham cracker crust, homemade caramel with bananas, and whipped cream...

It's in an odd location at a strip-mall that's tucked around the corner from a decent Mexican restaurant and a sub-shop.  \n\nI'm not sure if they're going for the feel of a mineshaft, but it was ridiculously cold in there.  I'm all for beating the heat, but to go from 104 to 62 degrees was a little much for me.  \n\nI could talk more about the ambiance, which is mildly interesting, but the food is the most important thing.  I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala (Red curry) which had chicken, potato, and the red curry sauce.  The chicken was dry, as well as the curry sauce.  Mere days before I'd had Chicken red curry at George and Dragon in Phoenix, which was really good.  The pasty was not on par with that.  I have to say it was one of the more bland curries I've ever had.  Perhaps I should have tried something like their Bangers and Mash or Shepherd's Pie.\n\nAs for the price, everything on the menu should cost about 20% less.  I think Cornish Pasty is WAY overpriced.  Some of the more traditional stuff is $7 to $7.50, while everything else is $8-9.  Beer is also a little on the pricey side (20 ounce drafts are $5-6) for this kind of place.  Two Boddington's and a pasty were $18 before tax and tip.  So if you absolutely have to have a pasty then I guess this is your place, otherwise there are some other fabulous places nearby that won't break the bank.",

            "text": "Who doesn't like pastries??? And savory pastries, much less. An 'Oggie', is the classic pasty that is still savored in Cornwall and all over the UK today. After hearing so many locals rave about the famous pastry, I had to pay the Cornish Pastry Company a visit. Talk about a British pub. This place mimics the dark, mysterious alley pubs in England. The restaurant is dim, moody and spacious with pool tables, a huge bar area and a misted patio. The vibe was very mellow on a weekday afternoon, but I can imagine it gets fairly busy on the weekends. After studying the extensive list of pastries (over two dozen), I went with the Carne Adovada from the premium list and the Cajun Chicken from the signature list and a side of the the broccoli cauliflower bake.\n\nThe broccoli cauliflower bake was delivered first. Think: healthy take on mac and cheese without giving up any of the flavor. The broccoli cauliflower dish was swimming in this wonderful cheese sauce and baked with tons of cheese on top creating a perfectly crisp exterior. Definitely delicious and a must order. \n\nThe pastries came next. Similar to a calzone but a lot less doughy, and a lot more flakey; the dough recipe is perfect because it is not overpowering to the savory delicious fillings. The Adovada was filled with simmered pork in New Mexican red chili stew, Mexican rice, hatch chilies and cheddar with a side of sour cream and salsa (the sides are switched in the photos). The pork was so tender and flavorful and the stew and chilies added a perfect kick. This was a British take on a Mexican influenced dish and it was a winner. The Cajun Chicken was filled with spicy cajun chicken breast, bacon, ham and Swiss and served with a side of chipotle sauce. The chicken was tender and the bacon added the right amount of smokiness paired with the chipotle sauce. I enjoyed this pastry as well, but the Adovada was the winner.\n\nWith so many options to choose from, you really can't go wrong here. I spend about fifteen minutes on the menu trying to decide which pasty to choose. There is something for everyone here with flavors ranging form Spanish influence, to Indian influence, to Mediterranean influence. The service was on point as well. We were directed to the main seating area by the host and the waitress took time to point out some of her favorites on the menu. She didn't seem to be very knowledgable on what each pasty included and the sauces were switched on my pastries, but all was forgiven after the first bite.

            "text": "Ok, I was at Lawrence Dunham Vineyards across the street for their grand opening and someone said you have to try the Cornish Pasty Company across the street. Being a big fan of Pasties and Shepherd/Cottage pie.. we gave it a try. The starter we ordered was some Vindaloo (I believe) hot wings. They were perfectly charred and still moist inside with a nice spicy kick.  \n\nThe main entree's we split were the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Cottage Pie. WOW! What a lovely treat when the mains came out. The Chickent Tikka Masala was quite spicy and moist without having so much juice that it made a huge mess. The yogurt sauce was a nice calming flavor to counteract the spicy red curry. Usually you do not get a real curry kick when you go to a restaurant so be aware that this is the real thing. It's wonderfully spicy for those of you with a low tolerance just order something else. For those of you who adore curry and wanted an easy and tasty new way to eat it here in the U.S. this is for you.  I only say that because it's not the usual dish served up in the U.S. while pies and pasties have been the norm in the UK forever.  Big hit #1\n\nThe second was the Cottage Pie (shepherds=beef / cottage=lamb)  and this is so perfect. A nice mild lamb flavor with a wonderful cheesy, potato mix that is served with a red wine gravy. You get all the moisture without having a dripping mess on your hands. So perfectly cooked, and filling. If you want a great comfort food this is the one. Don't be fooled when you see it, this is one filling meal. I had trouble finishing although I couldn't keep from eating more than my stomach told me to. Loved it from start to finish.  \n\nThe crust is nice and golden brown, not to thick but more than enough to keep everything inside. It's so flaky and perfect I have no complaints and had to write a review.  The photo I took is showing the Cottage Pie... the Chicken Tikka is the other half you can't see the inside of. The sauce is the yogurt sauce for the Tikka as it was dark and was the better sauce to show up in my photo. \n\nGive it a try..it's worth stepping a few blocks out of the usually higher traveled old town area. This is worth getting up and driving out of the way for when you want a comfortable setting with plenty of outdoor seating, a huge bar with what looked like  a lot of beer choices. I loved the feel and the crowd it just had even with the smaller early week crowd. It was definitely bringing a bit of that Urban fun and people that Scottsdale needs. Just get there and enjoy.",

I was looking for a place to grab some good food and a couple beers before a concert so I checked out Yelp and it did not lead me astray.\n\nTo me, a place like this is why Yelp needs to exist.  It was not in the most obvious location and when the group I was with went to walk in the front door we almost didn't know we were in the right place.  Let's just say their limited space is used very efficiently.  For what this place lacks in size, it makes up in character.\n\nInside it was kind of dark with some chairs lining the bar long the open kitchen and on the other wall a few small tables.  We found our spot in the back which was probably the only table big enough for 6 people.  The place was full and the noise level was just right; busy, but comfortable to have some lively dinner conversation. (Especially after some Irish Car Bombs.)\n\nTheir draft beer selection stuck to the UK theme with a lot of beers from that region.  I was especially surprised to see some Strongbow Cider.  They also had a few good micro brews from places like Firestone and Rogue.  Between that selection and the 32 oz. monster glasses they'd serve it in, this place was already a winner.\n\nMost importantly, their food was excellent.  I had the TIki Masala pasty and my wife had the Chicken Greek.  The Tiki Masala would be a great dish served by itself in an Indian restaurant.  Put it in a pasty and it's game over.  I tasted my wife's Chicken Greek which I probably wouldn't have picked as one of my own top choices to order and it was awesome.\n\nWe unanimously agreed this place was great and we had a laugh about some review around here that compared it to a Hot Pocket.  LOL.  I'll have to save that one under, \"Knowing about good food - FAIL!\"",

After hearing so many locals rave about the famous pastry, I had to pay the Cornish Pastry Company a visit. Talk about a British pub. This place mimics the dark, mysterious alley pubs in England. The restaurant is dim, moody and spacious with pool tables, a huge bar area and a misted patio. The vibe was very mellow on a weekday afternoon, but I can imagine it gets fairly busy on the weekends. After studying the extensive list of pastries (over two dozen), I went with the Carne Adovada from the premium list and the Cajun Chicken from the signature list and a side of the the broccoli cauliflower bake.\n\nThe broccoli cauliflower bake was delivered first. Think: healthy take on mac and cheese without giving up any of the flavor. The broccoli cauliflower dish was swimming in this wonderful cheese sauce and baked with tons of cheese on top creating a perfectly crisp exterior. Definitely delicious and a must order. \n\nThe pastries came next. Similar to a calzone but a lot less doughy, and a lot more flakey; the dough recipe is perfect because it is not overpowering to the savory delicious fillings. The Adovada was filled with simmered pork in New Mexican red chili stew, Mexican rice, hatch chilies and cheddar with a side of sour cream and salsa (the sides are switched in the photos). The pork was so tender and flavorful and the stew and chilies added a perfect kick. This was a British take on a Mexican influenced dish and it was a winner. The Cajun Chicken was filled with spicy cajun chicken breast, bacon, ham and Swiss and served with a side of chipotle sauce. The chicken was tender and the bacon added the right amount of smokiness paired with the chipotle sauce. I enjoyed this pastry as well, but the Adovada was the winner.\n\nWith so many options to choose from, you really can't go wrong here. I spend about fifteen minutes on the menu trying to decide which pasty to choose. There is something for everyone here with flavors ranging form Spanish influence, to Indian influence, to Mediterranean influence. The service was on point as well. We were directed to the main seating area by the host and the waitress took time to point out some of her favorites on the menu. She didn't seem to be very knowledgable on what each pasty included and the sauces were switched on my pastries, but all was forgiven after the first bite.

And I'm so glad we came! They were pretty busy at 8:30pm on a Saturday night. Walked in, sat ourselves, and a server showed up a couple minutes later to take our drink orders. I'd say they were a bit slow and not as attentive as I'd like but its more of a pub feel and they were pretty busy anyway. We ordered the Crispin hard ale to share and it was pretty tasty, not very sweet. I like how they have a large selection international beers (like King Fisher from India!) on their menu, its like you really are in an English pub!\n\nOur group got the Porky, Rosemary chicken, Lamb vindaloo, and chicken tikka masala pasties. We also ordered the broccoli and cauliflower bake and banana dessert. They were all good but I loved my lamb vindaloo, it was like actual lamb vindaloo that you would get at an Indian restaurant! Ironically the chicken tikka was my least favorite because it was too tomato-ey but it wasn't terrible. The yogurt sauce that came with complemented the pasty perfectly. \n\nThe broccoli cauliflower bake was delicious and cheesy, totally hit the spot on a cold night! The banoffe banana dessert was ok but I was disappointed that it was mostly whipped cream (unsweetened). The caramel, graham cracker crust and sliced bananas were still enough to carry on the dish. \n\nOverall great food, fun casual atmosphere ( saw LOTS of people on dates here) and totally worth checking out if you're in Tempe!",

With an incredible beer selection, nice and friendly wait staff, and incredible food, the Pasty is one of my favorite places in Tempe, hands down. \n\nTo start, get yourself one of the many awesome beers they have on tap. If you're planning on staying a while to enjoy the brand new patio (with heaters and misters), I would recommend getting an extra large glass. 32 ounces of fun. \n\nNext, go ahead and get yourself a cup of one of their awesome soups. Personal favorite: Red Pepper. Spicy, fresh, and delicious. If soup isn't your thing, I would recommend the oven chips -- oven-cooked french fries with cracked pepper. Definitely add the jalapeno. \n\nFor the main course, obviously a pasty is the way to go. My favorites include The Mexican (spiced steak strips, eggs, potatoes, jalapenos), The Royale with Cheese (hamburger, french fries, grilled onions, bacon, cheddar/swiss blend), and the Chicken Pot Pie (chicken, carrots, red potato, green beans, celery). \n\nFinish your meal off with a class Cornish Pasty desert: The Banoffee Pie. Graham cracker crust, homemade caramel with bananas, and whipped cream... If you're not melting already you should get to a past shoppe ASAP. \n\n5/5 for incredible atmosphere, food, staff, and overall experience. HIGHLY recommend.",

I'm currently having an affair with their Greek pasty--in both vegetarian and non-vegetarian forms, it's amazing. Their tzatziki sauce is out of this world--and I don't usually like yogurt-based sauces. In fact, I can't think of a yogurt sauce I do like! Other tzatzikis fall flat in comparison. This one is great! We love the Italian, Cajun, Oggie, Greek, steak... oh, and do NOT forget the sticky toffee pudding for dessert! OM NOM NOM.",

Clearly, I've been missing out!  \n\nThis place is a dark, dimly lit british pub-style restaurant.  It was completely slammed, with loads of mostly college aged people.  Everyone seemed to be laughing, talking, and having a genuinely good time.  We sat at the best seats in the house, the bar, and got to watch the staff work their magic. From there, you could see most of the kitchen work as well as the bar work.  Always fun, and the staff were plenty entertaining, ha ha.\n\nMy wife and I each tried a pasty to share, me the Oggie, and Stacy had the shepherds pie.  The Oggie is their traditional pasty, with steak, potatoes, onion and rutabaga (swede) with a side of red wine gravy or ketchup. So good!  I also tried some of my wife's, which was very good as well.  In addition, we split an order of the chips (fries).  The food took a while, but it's all made fresh and baked, and very much worth the wait.  It was cooked to perfection!\n\nWe had a GREAT experience here, and can't wait to go back.  Do yourself a favor and go check them out!",

Expect to sit alongside your mates and clip your bag to the bar as the place is truly tiny. Husband also got a light ale. \nRight away they wanted to take the order, but the menu is a fun adventure and as a first visit I really wanted to read all the selections. My family was starving so they just couldn't wait for me to meander over the varieties and the waitress was really eager to get moving. She said take your time, but she stood right there and so, I did feel a bit rushed. As a result I didn't order a side salad which I think would have made me happier.\nI was wondering if the Pasty was going to be enough, was it going to be soggy or burnt, was the crust going to be doughy or dry?  I mean I'm naturally a skeptical critic, why else would I Yelp? But my Pasty was perfect. It was not greasy, it was flaky but firm in the right parts, it wasn't burnt anywhere it was divine. My Pasty was not chock full of air pockets it was chock full of filling. My daughter could only eat half (she's 9) but the adults were perfectly satisfied without being bloated.\nI could bring my veggie friends/family here too.\nI knocked a star off because despite being not too busy we waited and waited to close out our check. She was too fast taking the order, and too slow to close us out. We didn't get to order any dessert because of our long wait with empty plates. Despite the unevenness of the service no one was rude or unpleasant and the pocket was so good we'll come back.  Next time I'm going to have the Reuben stuffed in there, my daughter wants to try the meatball and my husband just might have a Pilgrim (Thanksgiving in your hands! Lovely!) I know everyone can find a Pasty that they would like to eat here and I encourage you to go!\nUpdate: We did go back and have the above selections and I got a Chicken Tikka salad to share. Fabulous! I enjoyed the second visit even more. The Pilgrim is undeniably yum, the Reuben was chockfull of flavor, the meatball delighted my daughter but was so-so for me. The Indian spiced chicken was so tasty I wish they made it into a Pasty too. They do Lamb Vindaloo, so why not? I still recommend this place and will likely return a thrid time... so yummy.",

The friendliness of the wait staff and comfy and casual atmosphere of this place won me over pretty quickly though. After reading reviews here I decided to order the chicken tikka masala and that did not disappoint. My brother got their original with steak and potatoes and he loved that as well. Those little things are really filling. I came in ravenously hungry thinking I would have room in my stomach after finishing the whole thing, but after half I was already satiated.",

The crust on these pies are flaky, tasty delicious. The fillings are delicious, and they definitely don't skimp on the filling.

And if you enjoy the occasional beer, Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar is my favorite and they have it on tap, they actually have a pretty good selection of brews. \n    If you have not tried the Cornish Pasty Company yet, you are doing yourself a great disservice, you can stop by today and get a cold beer a warm pasty and a full stomach for well under twenty bucks.

Much more fun that way and worth the calories!\n\nIt has expanded since the last time I was there.

I would have never considered this place (because of its location and I had never heard about it before) if it weren't for my fiance who had read a review and decided that we should give it a try.  To my amazement, this place is actually very cool!  I can't think of another place like it anywhere.  I have tried about 4 or 5 of their pasties and they have all been excellent.  I can only describe them as \"calzones filled with awesomeness\".  There has to be at least 15 different ones to choose from and they are all probably very tasty.  I cannot vouch for how healthy the things are, but they are very good.  At about 7ish dollars for a pasty they are a good value because they fill you up quite nicely.\n\nWith my meal, I usually get a salad (their dressing is amazing), the mashed peas and the roasted potatoes.  Sometimes I can't help but have one (or more) of their $3 Irish car bombs.  The salad, peas and potatoes are enough to share with 2-3 people, but keep the car bombs for yourself!\n\nMy only complaint about this place is the seating.  If you have a party of 3 or more you just shouldn't go there.  Not only is the place tiny, the tables are only for 2 people.  I think they only have 1 or 2 tables that can accommodate more.  There is a bar area and that is where I dine because the tables are usually filled.\n\nOur new thing is to pre-order a few pasties.  They have them ready in just a few minutes, you pick them up, then pop them in your own oven.  This way we don't have to worry about seating.  \n\nAlso, the service there is always friendly and fast, but always a bit frenzied because the place is always so busy.",

The vegetables were cooked perfectly, as they were fresh and still a little crunchy. \n\nLiterally my only complaint about this place is that my meal was so good I kept trying to bite into it while it was still hot, burning my mouth multiple times.

So I called in at noon on a Sunday for a phone order. I ordered the Oggie since it seems like the popular item on the menu. I also wanted to try the oven baked chips, so I ordered that with garlic and jalapenos. \n\nWhen I arrived there, it had a fun, vibrant bar atmosphere. I like the decor, I noticed the whiskey bottles had this icicles on it. I went to the cashier/front to pick up my phone order. The cashier was very nice and responsive to my needs. Since my order wasn't ready, he kept asking me if I would like a drink. The wait staff also seems responsive and quick to others.\n\nIn terms of the food, the oggie was delicious. It was my first time trying an oggie. The outside was baked nicely and crispy. It wasn't soggy. It had a nice crisp but soft texture. The inside filling was soft and the flavors went well together. The red wine gravy also added great flavors to the oggie. Gravy was slightly sweet but also savory, so it brought out the flavors of the onions, potatoes and the beef of the inside of the oggie. The oven baked chips tasted like typical oven fries. The added garlic was delicious but the garlic aroma/flavor wasn't as strong as I would like. The jalapenos definitely added a kick to it, I wasn't expecting it to be that spicy. I ate the fries with the jalapeno and found it to be very spicy. Whenever I had garlic with the fries, it was delicious but I wanted more garlic to it. \n\nOggie reminds me of San Francisco's version of a peasant pie but slightly bigger and the outside has more flavor to it. It seems buttery, flakely. The SF one reminds me of a pot pie without a crispy crust.",

I typically call in my order and by the time I arrive (10-15 mins.) it is all ready for me to take home. Oddly, I usually do this on days when I'm hurting from a terrible hangover. Their menu, which is available online, has so many options and they all seem freaking incredible. However, when I'm hungover I usually want something very filling and comforting. So the very first pasty I called in was a shepherd's pie, then I'm asked if I want lamb (a true shepherd's pie) or beef (a cottage pie). Lamb, of course! It was so delicious it's the only one I've ever gotten. I just can't seem to bring myself to deviate and that's not really like me, especially when everyone raves about all the others. Someday. I'll surely be going back, maybe one day I'll actually eat there and enjoy the ambiance and maybe, just maybe I'll try something new. This place rocks!

Where do you want to go?\" It is a bit tucked away in a little strip mall, so I'm going to chalk it up to location and not the fact that I typically have the memory of a gnat.\n\nIf you've never had a pasty (pronounced pah-stee, unlike the pay-stee nipple adhesives strippers wear), you're missing out on a hearty English Hot Pocket. However, likening it to a Hot Pocket does it a disservice. Hot Pockets consist of cardboard crust filled with nuclear hot goo that causes blisters and cursing, rather than sighs of content and delight. While both are great drunk/hangover food, the Cornish Pasty Co. far surpasses the measly freezer dried Hot Pocket. \n\nWhile they have flavors that are also available as Hot Pocket varieties (taste test!), my dining partner routinely reminds me that he will shun me for indulge in one of those. Not that it's hard to find at least five different flavors that you could imagine chowing down. I always end up just blurting out my decision at the last minute to end my indecisiveness. They updated the menu recently and it now includes a bunch of flavors that weren't previously available, like carne adovada. Mmm. So if you haven't been here in a while, give it another go and try something new.\n\nFor about seven bucks you get a huge, stick-to-your-ribs pastry filled with a wide variety of meats and vegetables. I've never tried the vegetarian choices, but there are quite a few on the menu (about half as many as the non-vegetarian options). Among the traditional pasties, you can't go wrong with the oggie, shepards pie or lamb and mint. I've tried the chicken tikka masala, greek chicken, and lamb vindaloo from the fancy schmancy options and they were just as stellar. The greek salad is also pretty respectable, with a hefty amount of kalamata olives and feta cheese. \n\nWatching the cooks at work is part of the fun at this place, so have a seat at the bar. Just make sure to do so far enough away from the oven that you won't end up dried out like beef jerky at the end of your meal. When you get the bill, there's a cashier near the door that you can cash out at if you're in a hurry, since the servers are a little bit on the slow side. Slow, laid back, whatever. \n\nTheir happy hour is also an awesome option to opt for, and is offered every day from 3 to 5 pm. There's a dollar off beers, three dollar Irish car bombs and two dollar top shelf shots (Ketel One vodka, Jameson whiskey, etc.), so if you're looking to spend an afternoon getting stinko and munching on some awesome food, this is the place to be.\n\nUPDATE: I've tried just about every non-veggie pasty on the menu. The salmon trumps them all. Do it.",

Personal favorite: Red Pepper. Spicy, fresh, and delicious. If soup isn't your thing, I would recommend the oven chips -- oven-cooked french fries with cracked pepper. Definitely add the jalapeno. \n\nFor the main course, obviously a pasty is the way to go. My favorites include The Mexican (spiced steak strips, eggs, potatoes, jalapenos), The Royale with Cheese (hamburger, french fries, grilled onions, bacon, cheddar/swiss blend), and the Chicken Pot Pie (chicken, carrots, red potato, green beans, celery). \n\nFinish your meal off with a class Cornish Pasty desert: The Banoffee Pie. Graham cracker crust, homemade caramel with bananas, and whipped cream...

It's hamburger, cheese, onion, mushrooms bacon, and the best part - fries all snuggled into a flaky pasty crust. I like to dip mine into ranch for that classic burger tastiness.\nThe Pilgrim is thanksgiving dinner. It's turkey, sweet potatoes, stuffing and onions. Served with a side of cranberries and gravy. \nI always have a hard time choosing between the two because they are both so delicious. \n\nThe place itself has a cool, laid back vibe and the staff is always friendly.\n\nThe pasties do take a while to make though so expect to wait a while. These are not fast food in any sense of the term. If you are in a hurry, this is not the place for you. Especially at lunch.\n\nAlso, their seating is really best set up for groups of two.  This is not a \"take the whole family out for dinner\" kinda place. They have a couple tables in the back that can seat four but the majority of tables are two-tops and then there is space at the bar.\n\nNo question, Cornish Pasty Company is one of my favorite places in the valley.",

            "text": "Let me first start off by saying that I love Cornish Pasty. So why the three star review? Well, their food is great, but the service is lousy. But let me back up a bit.\n\nThe very first time someone told me about \"The Pasty,\" as I refer to it, they described a pasty as \"a gourmet hot pocket.\" Let me tell you, that did not sound appealing. Despite how great they tried to make it sound, I could not get over the idea of a gourmet hot pocket. So I never checked it out until maybe a year ago when I was recommended by another friend, and figured I'd just give it a shot. It was delightful!\n\nI've since been to The Pasty multiple times. It's the food that keeps me coming back. \"The Pilgrim\" is like Thanksgiving! I get it almost every time. It's a combination of turkey, sweet potatoes, onions, mushrooms, and other wonderful flavors inside. Served with a side of cranberry sauce and a red wine gravy. I'm not too crazy about the gravy, but the cranberry sauce is awesome. I've also tried their Greek salad and black bean soup, which are just as wonderful. I love the bread that comes with the soup, and the dressing on the salad.\n\nAlthough this location is closer to my house, I prefer going to the one on Guadalupe and Dobson because the service is slightly better (although both locations have poor service). And this location on University is way too dark and full of hipsters. But, I guess people dig that nowadays.\n\nThe main reason I'm writing this review is because of a trip I made to this location yesterday. I went with my boyfriend and we split all three items mentioned above. The Greek salad, black bean soup, and The Pilgrim. I was starving and was hoping our server would bring the soup and salad out first. I was thrilled when she came back after a couple minutes with the soup and was hoping the salad would come out shortly after. I love bread and when we ran out of bread (meaning after I scarfed all the bread down), I patiently waited for our server to come back around so I could ask for more bread, as well as the status on our salad. Remember when I said I was starving? Well, I start to get a little cranky when I'm hungry, and our server was not making any rounds to see how her tables were doing. After fifteen or so minutes, I decide to go over to where our server is talking with another server, and ask for more bread, nicely of course. Once she comes back with our bread, the soup is cold, but I don't really mind. I was just happy she put more bread in front of me. A few minutes later our pasty comes out. She had obviously forgotten about our salad (guess that's what happens when you don't write anything down) so I reminded her and she comes back shortly with it. Only after we had been sitting there for ten minutes after we had finished everything and the busser, who was much friendly than our server, had already cleared the table, did our server appear from the darkness and we were finally able to get our check, pay, and leave. I'm used to the service being not so great, but this was just awful.\n\nI thought maybe if I wrote a review about my last experience, they'd change the service up or hire better servers. Serving itself isn't very hard, I know, I've done it. And it doesn't take much effort to check up on a table. But the people who work at The Pasty just don't seem to care about anything. I guess that's just a hipster thing. (I would love to see their interview process, if there even is one. \"Do you know how to carry food?\" \"Yes.\" \"Okay, you're hired.\")\n\nAnyway, I think I will be driving out of the way to go to the other Pasty instead. Since their servers are a little more attentive and I can actually see who I'm eating with, and what I'm eating for that matter. Hah, I can only imagine what that place looks like in the light. Maybe they keep it dark for a reason.\n\nIt's not like I'm expecting five star service or anything, I get that it's a bar too. But come on. If you're the type that doesn't like their server to stop by a lot, or you don't need any refills, then this place would be perfect for you.",

We have consistently had great service when eating here, the waiters and waitresses are always very friendly and talkative, it's a fun place to be. \nThe food is top notch and super cheap, you can leave totally full and pay less than ten bucks, incredible. We have probably been here a couple dozen times and I have tried a large majority of the menu and have not found a pasty I didn't enjoy yet. Kristen's favorites are the Italian, which is pepperoni, salami, ham, mozzarella, basil and tomatoes with a marinara dipping sauce and the Pilgrim, which is turkey, sweet potatoes, grilled onions, stuffing and a red wine gravy, and I can attest, they are both delicious. My favorites are the Mexican, which is spiced steak strips, potatoes, eggs, hatch chilies and cheddar with a side of sour cream and the Shepard's Pie, which is lamb, peas, carrots, grilled onions, mashed potatoes and cheddar with a side of gravy, these are both like heaven in your mouth. And if you enjoy the occasional beer, Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar is my favorite and they have it on tap, they actually have a pretty good selection of brews. \n    If you have not tried the Cornish Pasty Company yet, you are doing yourself a great disservice, you can stop by today and get a cold beer a warm pasty and a full stomach for well under twenty bucks. You having nothing to lose.",

Then one day someone eaves dropped on our convo, and corrected me. So now I say it right most of the time..\n\nAnyway, this place is great.  Its cheap and its good.  The last time I came I had the Oggie.  Its one of their traditional pasties.  It has steak, potatoes, onion and rutabaga (swede) with a side of red wine gravy.   I am always attempting different pasties everytime I come. And every single one has been great so far.  Hubby had the Cajun Chicken and that was good.\n\nTheir pasties run from $8-9.50.  You get a nice portion size and if you really feel like sharing you can do with one.  But I recommend getting your own and doing a nice switch with one half of your pasty.  Much more fun that way and worth the calories!\n\nIt has expanded since the last time I was there.  So if you walk in and see that cramped area where they do all the cooking; keep walking and you will see that it opens up to a nice spacious area.  We learned the hard way.  After sitting for awhile, we were watching the cooks take out pasty after pasty.  We kept looking around, wondering what the hell?!  We thought we were the only ones.  But I finally decided to see what was up, lo and behold!  A whole new section.\n\nOverall a wonderful place",

To my amazement, this place is actually very cool!  I can't think of another place like it anywhere.  I have tried about 4 or 5 of their pasties and they have all been excellent.  I can only describe them as \"calzones filled with awesomeness\".  There has to be at least 15 different ones to choose from and they are all probably very tasty.  I cannot vouch for how healthy the things are, but they are very good.  At about 7ish dollars for a pasty they are a good value because they fill you up quite nicely.\n\nWith my meal, I usually get a salad (their dressing is amazing), the mashed peas and the roasted potatoes.  Sometimes I can't help but have one (or more) of their $3 Irish car bombs.  The salad, peas and potatoes are enough to share with 2-3 people, but keep the car bombs for yourself!\n\nMy only complaint about this place is the seating.  If you have a party of 3 or more you just shouldn't go there.  Not only is the place tiny, the tables are only for 2 people.  I think they only have 1 or 2 tables that can accommodate more.  There is a bar area and that is where I dine because the tables are usually filled.\n\nOur new thing is to pre-order a few pasties.  They have them ready in just a few minutes, you pick them up, then pop them in your own oven.  This way we don't have to worry about seating.  \n\nAlso, the service there is always friendly and fast, but always a bit frenzied because the place is always so busy.",

This tasted like growing up in the midwest in the 60s/70s - salt, pepper, beef, potatoes, onions, and some 'exotic' red wine gravy.  Nice bit of time travel during  lunch.  This was a hearty meal, and I enjoyed it.\n\nThe restaurant is cool looking - lots of trestle tables where you can sit with a big group of friends, or join some not-yet-friends who are already there.  Indoor/outdoor bar (wrong time of year for the outdoor part, but good to bear in mind for when the weather gets back to perfect).",

You walk in and it is like someone forgot to turn on the lights.  I have no idea why it needs to be so dark but it is hard to enjoy your meal.  I am all about a dive or a little hole in the wall but the decor and tables in this place are just too much to get over.  I mentioned to a friend that they must keep the lights out so you don't notice how bad everything is.  The waitress we had was just horrible.  She took forever to come by and when she did she was put off by our questions. She was able to offer a few recommendations as this was my fiends first time there.

            "text": "Ok, I was at Lawrence Dunham Vineyards across the street for their grand opening and someone said you have to try the Cornish Pasty Company across the street. Being a big fan of Pasties and Shepherd/Cottage pie.. we gave it a try. The starter we ordered was some Vindaloo (I believe) hot wings. They were perfectly charred and still moist inside with a nice spicy kick.  \n\nThe main entree's we split were the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Cottage Pie. WOW! What a lovely treat when the mains came out. The Chickent Tikka Masala was quite spicy and moist without having so much juice that it made a huge mess. The yogurt sauce was a nice calming flavor to counteract the spicy red curry. Usually you do not get a real curry kick when you go to a restaurant so be aware that this is the real thing. It's wonderfully spicy for those of you with a low tolerance just order something else. For those of you who adore curry and wanted an easy and tasty new way to eat it here in the U.S. this is for you.  I only say that because it's not the usual dish served up in the U.S. while pies and pasties have been the norm in the UK forever.  Big hit #1\n\nThe second was the Cottage Pie (shepherds=beef / cottage=lamb)  and this is so perfect. A nice mild lamb flavor with a wonderful cheesy, potato mix that is served with a red wine gravy. You get all the moisture without having a dripping mess on your hands. So perfectly cooked, and filling. If you want a great comfort food this is the one. Don't be fooled when you see it, this is one filling meal. I had trouble finishing although I couldn't keep from eating more than my stomach told me to. Loved it from start to finish.  \n\nThe crust is nice and golden brown, not to thick but more than enough to keep everything inside. It's so flaky and perfect I have no complaints and had to write a review.  The photo I took is showing the Cottage Pie... the Chicken Tikka is the other half you can't see the inside of. The sauce is the yogurt sauce for the Tikka as it was dark and was the better sauce to show up in my photo. \n\nGive it a try..it's worth stepping a few blocks out of the usually higher traveled old town area. This is worth getting up and driving out of the way for when you want a comfortable setting with plenty of outdoor seating, a huge bar with what looked like  a lot of beer choices. I loved the feel and the crowd it just had even with the smaller early week crowd. It was definitely bringing a bit of that Urban fun and people that Scottsdale needs. Just get there and enjoy.",

The place is very hipster, dark and packed. It definitely seems like a Sherlock holmes, batman night out. \n\nThere are days when I crave for their Mushroom soup. Its one of the best soup i have had. They have creamy, walnut filled mushroom soup, served with house made bread and heaps of butter. You will never get tired of their bread. Cream of tomato with croutons is good too. We generally order Tandoori wings for our appetizer, which is cooked to perfection, not spicy and served with celery and ranch. When it comes to pasty, they are the boss. Their Lamb vidaloo, Chicken tikka masala brings out the complete flavor in a pasty form. The filling is delicious and their pasty, so soft made of complete butter just melts in the mouth, baked till crisp golden from the outside . One can eat just the plain pasty and crave for more. Spicy Asiago chicken and chicken pot pie are our next options. Please save room for desert, each ones unique but Apple caramel pasty you will not be disappointed.\n\nThey have a wide range of options and this place is definitely heaven for vegans too. The service is really good and you will find a lot of young hip crowd. The price is definitely reasonable and a great place to hangout with groups. I will keep visiting this place.",

It's not only the only place in Tempe you can get a cornish pasty, but they are also freak'n awesome.  The Lovely Bit of Salmon was my favorite, but alas given my newly discovered gluten intolerance I am not able to part-take in such loveliness any more:  :(\n\nBut nevertheless, I still come here every now and then with my friends and husband.  They all chow down on the yummy pasties while I chow down on my salads, sides, and soups.  So, I decided to concentrate my review on those items. (Some of these dishes are not gluten free.  I had them before I found out about my gluten intolerance.) \n\nSoups:\nThey offer a variety of soups.  I have tried: 1) the cream of leek, potato, and stilton, 2) the cream of tomato and crouton, and 3) the red pepper, black bean, rice, chicken, and jalapeno.  They were all very good, but I was informed that only the red pepper one is gluten free.  I had the first two before I found out about my gluten intolerance.  Not only are their soups really tasty, full of flavor, they are all also accompanied by thick slices of fresh bread and butter, baked and churned in-house.  Absolutely delicious!  The are perfect accompaniments, and a bowl at $4.75 would make a tasty and light lunch that won't break the bank.  \n\nSides: \nThe garlic mashed potatoes and the garlic roasted potatoes are also very good.  Pretty much what you should expect.  Creamy mashed potatoes and nicely roasted red potatoes with a hint of garlic.  Not too garlicky.  \n\nThe mushy peas is one of my favorite side dishes that they serve.  I think I prefer them to the potatoes simply because they are something different that I can't get anywhere else.  And these ain't  no ordinary peas.  They are huge for peas.  Cooked really well.  Not too mushy (overcooked), even though they are \"mushy\" peas. There is a great texture and freshness to this dish.  The texture of these \"mushy peas\" is more like crunchy peanut butter than creamy peanut butter if we were speaking of peanut butter that is (it's an analogy. . . just go with it), and I think the freshness and the texture go hand in hand from not overcooking the peas.  \n\nThe broccoli and cauliflower cheese bake is also a nice dish.  It makes me think of mac'n cheese, but with cauliflower and broccoli instead of mac noodles.  I dont think this dish is gluten free.  It seems to be made with a cheese sauce that is thickened with a flour rue, then baked to give a nice golden, crusted top.  It was tasty as well, but could have used a bit more seasoning.  It was my least favorite of all the sides I have had. \n\nAll their salads are also pretty good.  The veggies in the salad are pretty much the same regardless of which salad you get: ice berg lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and onions.  Except for the Greek and pasta.  The Greek has feta and olives, and the pasta has a whole list of its own ingredients.  \n\nWhat differentiates the various salads are the additions and the dressing.  Beside the basic garden and Greek, the three other salads to choose from are: 1) the salmon or chicken caesar, 2) the chicken tikka salad, and 3) the sausage salad.  The salmon caesar is a great substitute for the Lovely Bit of Salmon pasty.  The salmon is cooked very well.  Juicy, not overcooked and not undercooked, seasoned just like the salmon in the Lovely Bit of Salmon.  Ask for a side of the white wine and dill dressing that usually accompanies the Lovely Bit of Salmon and you will not regret it.  That sauce is amazing.  This is my favorite salad. The chicken tikka is also good.  The chicken is marinated in a red rub or spice, like what you would find with tandoori chicken, and served on a salad with yogurt dressing.  Finally, the sausage salad was not my favorite.  They make the sausage in house, but I was a bit disappointed with the flavor and the way it was cooked.  It was overcooked, very dry, and a bit off.  I'm not sure if I would order it again.  I've had it twice and it was the same both times.\n\nOverall, this is one of the best restaurants in Tempe!",

When I cut myself shaving, I bleed red wine gravy.\n\nI frequent CPC more than I should.  Guilty as charged.  The food is just...so damn good.  I'm also a fan of their dfraft beer selection.  32oz mugs of Hoegaarden or Dead Guy ale?  Yes, please.\n\nI've turned many people on to the wonders of this place.  Out of all of my friends that tried it, the only one that didn't fully appreciate it was the one that had a lap band.  I don't recommend this place if your stomach is the size of a walnut because there will be some damage.\n\nI've tried nearly all of the pasties (with the exception of the vegetarian ones) and it's difficult to pick a favorite.  I guess if I had to narrow it down to three, I'd choose (in no particular order), the Oggie, the chicken greek and the pilgrim.  Damn delectable!\n\nI've also had their pasta salad.  It's huge.  I probably wouldn't get it again, though.  Why would I get that when I could have a pasty?  I thought I knew what comfort food was until I had my first pasty.\n\nOK, so what about the interior?  There isn't much of it!  It's a hole in the wall.  The Mesa location is quite bigger, so if you're dead set on trying the food on a Friday or Saturday, you may want to check out the Mesa setting.\n\nI've only had to wait for a table once, and it wasn't for very long, but I tend to visit during the off hours (late afternoon or later in the evening).  If you're flying solo, don't be ashamed to hop on a bar stool and watch the 20 something hipster dudes cook up gravy and other vittles.   \n\nSpeaking of the employees, they're a motley bunch.  Service is usually pretty decent.  If you're a fan of tattoos, nearly all of the employees are inked.  It definitely lends a sense of style to the place.  \n\nThere's a single unisex bathroom in the back.  If you gotta go, you gotta go.  I suggest forming a line if it's in use because I've seen people treat it like an airplane bathroom: they'll keep looking over their shoulder to see if the person inside has left and then get up, only to be cut off at the pass by someone seated closer doing the same bit.\n\nI've only had one bad pasty experience.  My pasty was slightly over-baked.  I think the guy that baked it was over-baked, too.  Look at the eyes of some of the cooks.  They're redder than the gravy!\n\nAt any rate, that one pasty doesn't warrant the loss of a star compared to the dozens of other perfect pasties that I've had.  I recommend this place to everyone.  Leave your diet in your car and enjoy yourself.",

To drink it's fun to get a snakebite-- Cider+Guinness.  Go for the vegetarian \"chicken\" tikka masala pasty with yogurt dipping sauce all the way!!

I remember the first time we went after hearing about it here on Yelp, we ended up leaving with the 'ole \"where have you been my whole life\" feeling.

It is small on the inside, a narrow straight corridor with, I believe, nine table, most of them two seaters, and while it has no big budget decorations, it is completely inviting and welcoming. It just feels right inside, a combination of old mining photos and 1940's country, a bare floor and a huge bar with completely open kitchen area to chat with the cooks while imbibing. We have consistently had great service when eating here, the waiters and waitresses are always very friendly and talkative, it's a fun place to be. \nThe food is top notch and super cheap, you can leave totally full and pay less than ten bucks, incredible. We have probably been here a couple dozen times and I have tried a large majority of the menu and have not found a pasty I didn't enjoy yet. Kristen's favorites are the Italian, which is pepperoni, salami, ham, mozzarella, basil and tomatoes with a marinara dipping sauce and the Pilgrim, which is turkey, sweet potatoes, grilled onions, stuffing and a red wine gravy, and I can attest, they are both delicious. My favorites are the Mexican, which is spiced steak strips, potatoes, eggs, hatch chilies and cheddar with a side of sour cream and the Shepard's Pie, which is lamb, peas, carrots, grilled onions, mashed potatoes and cheddar with a side of gravy, these are both like heaven in your mouth. And if you enjoy the occasional beer, Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar is my favorite and they have it on tap, they actually have a pretty good selection of brews. \n    If you have not tried the Cornish Pasty Company yet, you are doing yourself a great disservice, you can stop by today and get a cold beer a warm pasty and a full stomach for well under twenty bucks.

I was looking for a place to grab some good food and a couple beers before a concert so I checked out Yelp and it did not lead me astray.\n\nTo me, a place like this is why Yelp needs to exist.  It was not in the most obvious location and when the group I was with went to walk in the front door we almost didn't know we were in the right place.  Let's just say their limited space is used very efficiently.  For what this place lacks in size, it makes up in character.\n\nInside it was kind of dark with some chairs lining the bar long the open kitchen and on the other wall a few small tables.  We found our spot in the back which was probably the only table big enough for 6 people.  The place was full and the noise level was just right; busy, but comfortable to have some lively dinner conversation. (Especially after some Irish Car Bombs.)\n\nTheir draft beer selection stuck to the UK theme with a lot of beers from that region.  I was especially surprised to see some Strongbow Cider.  They also had a few good micro brews from places like Firestone and Rogue.  Between that selection and the 32 oz. monster glasses they'd serve it in, this place was already a winner.\n\nMost importantly, their food was excellent.  I had the TIki Masala pasty and my wife had the Chicken Greek.  The Tiki Masala would be a great dish served by itself in an Indian restaurant.  Put it in a pasty and it's game over.  I tasted my wife's Chicken Greek which I probably wouldn't have picked as one of my own top choices to order and it was awesome.\n\nWe unanimously agreed this place was great and we had a laugh about some review around here that compared it to a Hot Pocket.  LOL.  I'll have to save that one under, \"Knowing about good food - FAIL!\"",

So I called in at noon on a Sunday for a phone order. I ordered the Oggie since it seems like the popular item on the menu. I also wanted to try the oven baked chips, so I ordered that with garlic and jalapenos. \n\nWhen I arrived there, it had a fun, vibrant bar atmosphere. I like the decor, I noticed the whiskey bottles had this icicles on it. I went to the cashier/front to pick up my phone order. The cashier was very nice and responsive to my needs. Since my order wasn't ready, he kept asking me if I would like a drink. The wait staff also seems responsive and quick to others.\n\nIn terms of the food, the oggie was delicious. It was my first time trying an oggie. The outside was baked nicely and crispy. It wasn't soggy. It had a nice crisp but soft texture. The inside filling was soft and the flavors went well together. The red wine gravy also added great flavors to the oggie. Gravy was slightly sweet but also savory, so it brought out the flavors of the onions, potatoes and the beef of the inside of the oggie. The oven baked chips tasted like typical oven fries. The added garlic was delicious but the garlic aroma/flavor wasn't as strong as I would like. The jalapenos definitely added a kick to it, I wasn't expecting it to be that spicy. I ate the fries with the jalapeno and found it to be very spicy. Whenever I had garlic with the fries, it was delicious but I wanted more garlic to it. \n\nOggie reminds me of San Francisco's version of a peasant pie but slightly bigger and the outside has more flavor to it. It seems buttery, flakely. The SF one reminds me of a pot pie without a crispy crust.",

I'd say they were a bit slow and not as attentive as I'd like but its more of a pub feel and they were pretty busy anyway. We ordered the Crispin hard ale to share and it was pretty tasty, not very sweet. I like how they have a large selection international beers (like King Fisher from India!) on their menu, its like you really are in an English pub!\n\nOur group got the Porky, Rosemary chicken, Lamb vindaloo, and chicken tikka masala pasties. We also ordered the broccoli and cauliflower bake and banana dessert. They were all good but I loved my lamb vindaloo, it was like actual lamb vindaloo that you would get at an Indian restaurant! Ironically the chicken tikka was my least favorite because it was too tomato-ey but it wasn't terrible. The yogurt sauce that came with complemented the pasty perfectly. \n\nThe broccoli cauliflower bake was delicious and cheesy, totally hit the spot on a cold night! The banoffe banana dessert was ok but I was disappointed that it was mostly whipped cream (unsweetened). The caramel, graham cracker crust and sliced bananas were still enough to carry on the dish. \n\nOverall great food, fun casual atmosphere ( saw LOTS of people on dates here) and totally worth checking out if you're in Tempe!",

My grandparents bought them at the grocery store premade - all we had to do was warm them up in the oven. When Cornish Pasty Co. announced they were going to open in Tempe back in 2005, I was ecstatic and for good reasons - it was love at first bite. \n\nSince 2005, I've tried many different pasties and still can't decide which my favorite is. The Oggie is a good standard- it's what my memory from Michigan tastes like only better. The Pilgrim is amazing - but only when made with Turkey. Honestly, my favorite part is the crust that holds the goodies. I don't care what is inside, as long as that crust is flakey and warm. Mmm... One time I ordered a small Greek Salad and now I have to order it every time I'm there. The dressing they use is this lemony pesto and it is so, so good... the only down side is that I'm still tasting it hours later. It's that strong! To finish up, you have got to order the chocolate bread pudding with crème angelias AND ice cream. The bread is deliciously chocolately but it is also soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside, which I love. The husband isn't too crazy about it (\"bread pudding shouldn't be crunchy!\"), but that means more for me!\n\nThey have happy hour starting at 3pm, which includes drink specials. I've only ordered a Gin and Tonic here and as far as I'm concerned, it's pretty damn good. One time they were out of tonic and they made a special trip to go out and buy some, just so I could have my drink. I felt pretty special that night.\n\nWe have been to the location in Mesa and the patio is really nice, but the original restaurant has rustic charm. Whether you are sitting at the bar top or in a corner booth, you can feel the energy of the restaurant and be intimate with your dining partner. It's nice they expanded the restaurant and were still able to keep the same ambiance. \n\nAnytime we are in Tempe, this is always one of our stops and a place we frequently take friends. If you are ever in the area, definitely stop in!!",

I remember the first time we went after hearing about it here on Yelp, we ended up leaving with the 'ole \"where have you been my whole life\" feeling. This place is awesome. \n    The Cornish Pasty is located on the side of a very random and small strip mall, if you didn't know you were looking for it you would probably not even notice it. It is small on the inside, a narrow straight corridor with, I believe, nine table, most of them two seaters, and while it has no big budget decorations, it is completely inviting and welcoming. It just feels right inside, a combination of old mining photos and 1940's country, a bare floor and a huge bar with completely open kitchen area to chat with the cooks while imbibing. We have consistently had great service when eating here, the waiters and waitresses are always very friendly and talkative, it's a fun place to be. \nThe food is top notch and super cheap, you can leave totally full and pay less than ten bucks, incredible. We have probably been here a couple dozen times and I have tried a large majority of the menu and have not found a pasty I didn't enjoy yet. Kristen's favorites are the Italian, which is pepperoni, salami, ham, mozzarella, basil and tomatoes with a marinara dipping sauce and the Pilgrim, which is turkey, sweet potatoes, grilled onions, stuffing and a red wine gravy, and I can attest, they are both delicious. My favorites are the Mexican, which is spiced steak strips, potatoes, eggs, hatch chilies and cheddar with a side of sour cream and the Shepard's Pie, which is lamb, peas, carrots, grilled onions, mashed potatoes and cheddar with a side of gravy, these are both like heaven in your mouth. And if you enjoy the occasional beer, Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar is my favorite and they have it on tap, they actually have a pretty good selection of brews. \n    If you have not tried the Cornish Pasty Company yet, you are doing yourself a great disservice, you can stop by today and get a cold beer a warm pasty and a full stomach for well under twenty bucks.

I used to drive by the place all the time and my so at the time used to joke about Cornish Pastys being what Cornish strippers wore in non nude establishments.  All I can say is yum!\n\nSo one day, we took the plunge and stopped by after work.  It's dark but not dank.  Narrow but not crowded.  Tasty but not super fast.  Pasty may not be a good every day staple.  But it sure is tasty!  I have tried at least a half dozen menu items and none have steered me wrong but for the real \"flava\" I'm gonna recommend you stick with the more traditional stuff.  Otherwise you could just end up eating a calzone in disguise and seriously... who wants to eat a Cornish calzone?\n\nThe staff is nice, and friendly.  The vibe is decent and if you like meat (or veggies)  and potatoes (which may technically be a veggie but is class by itself you know) stuffed into delicous bread.  You will feel as if you have died and gone to heaven.\n\nDo not be fooled by cheap imitations! This is not some gussied up hot pocket or some savory pop tart! This is the real deal!  After eating this you'll be ready to go into a coal mine and work for .. well no. That may be stretching the truth.  But the food is really good.\n\nOne time, I preordered from this place and got a bunch of parbaked Pasties for a Christmas Eve celebration.  They were a big hit.",

There's a reason why they're one of the best reviewed restaurants in Tempe. \n\nYou might also notice their success has them expanding to multiple locations. It takes awhile for these new locations to find their legs, but Tempe is the original Pasty that started it all. An excellent staff and unique atmosphere compliment some of the best food you're likely to find in the area.\n\nOh, and they have an extensive assortment of beers on tap, many imported. They treat the beer with respect here, ensuring every pint is served up fresh. It sounds gross, but many restaurants don't properly take care of the hoses that connect the beer to the tap -- you end up with half your beer sitting outside of the refrigeration and going stale. Pasty's staff make sure everything is fresh like any proper bar -- something unique for a restaurant to do.\n\nMy personal favorites include the Cajun Chicken, Tikka, Meat and Cheese and the Royale. Honestly, order anything off the menu and you really can't go wrong.\n\nMake sure if you order chips to ask the server for the 'wild' style, which includes baked garlic and fresh jalapenos. Adds an amazing kick.",

            "text": "A modern take on a British staple, Cornish Pasty Company has about 50 different pasties to choose from including at least 10 vegetarian pasties and even some dessert pasties too! \n\nThe restaurant has a Brit pub feel to it, with a bar bar on one side and a dining area and counter seating on the other. \n\nCornish Pasties were a working class food for miners. They were crimped at one end so that the miners with the soiled hands could eat them and just throw out the end they were holding. Here the pasties range from $9-$11 each and the pictures on Yelp can be deceiving. You may think they look like a empanada but in real life they are the size of calzone, they are large. \n\nMushroom, Walnut, Spinach Soup - I'm a big cream of mushroom fan so I had to try this out. I ordered a full bowl but they only brought me out a cup of it. I asked if it was a mistake and they said they were out of the soup for the night so they gave me the smaller cup for free! After one sip I was wishing there was a bowl of it, because it was that good. Creamy mushroom without overdoing it on the cream, pureed spinach and walnuts with a walnut chunk in almost every bite. Served with warm sourdough bread. One of the best versions of mushroom soup that I have ever had.\n\nLamb & Mint Pasty (Lamb, Potatoes, Rutabaga, Onion, Fresh Mint) - My friends got this and I tried a bite. It was good, not gamey at all and paired well with the red wine gravy. Recommended. \n\nPeppered Steak Pasty (Sirloin Steak, Sautéed Portabella Mushrooms, Leeks, Roasted Zucchini, Stilton Cheese) - My server recommended this and it was all good until I forgot that it had Stilton in it. Stilton is a strong bleu cheese.  Don't get me wrong, this pasty was done very well... I would have liked it better if it didn't have Stilton in it but that was my bad for missing that on the description. If you enjoy steak and blue cheese, you will love this! Personal preference aside, this is a 5 star pasty.  It comes with a side of peppercorn brandy cream sauce which is delicious. This sauce is lightly sweet and creamy with pepper flavor but no heat and would be great with most of their pasties. If you can, ask for a side of this even if your pasty doesn't come with it. \n\nIf I make it back to Phoenix I'm going to have to try the Pilgrim (turkey, sweet potatoes and cranberry sauce), the Oogie (steak, potatoes, rutabaga), Shepard's Pie and Chicken Tikka Masala. The veggie offerings also look stupendous. \n\nThe only thing a Brit would find lacking is in their beer offerings. They do not carry too many brews from the UK. You can't get a Black and Tan or a Smithwicks here. Not a biggie, but just thought I'd mention it. \n\nUnexpected was the staff giving me the soup for free when I would have gladly paid for the smaller portion offering since I did order it. It was only a $4.50 difference, but Cornish Pasty Company went above and beyond to get it right, even when they didn't have to. \n\nNow if only they could figure out how to open other Cornish Pasty Companies across the nation (California please?)...",

Our server came back with the wrong beers (really?) and then a different server greeted us (45 min. after sitting down) and we told her we were being helped by someone else. So the original server comes back with our beers and takes our food order - by the way, they do not have anything gluten free here, despite what other reviews say.

The second dining room is filled with old church pews for seating which I have mixed feelings about.

Food was great, huge selection but could have been a tad warmer (my choice). Beer choices good, unfortunately out of my first pick but can't knock 'em too bad for that, and a bit warmer as well (again, my choice). Wait staff very friendly and efficient.

It's ok; it's not like with a hot meal I'd like to chase it down with a beverage of sort. The kitchen guys have always been extremely helpful and I appreciate them.

I remember the first time we went after hearing about it here on Yelp, we ended up leaving with the 'ole \"where have you been my whole life\" feeling. This place is awesome. \n    The Cornish Pasty is located on the side of a very random and small strip mall, if you didn't know you were looking for it you would probably not even notice it. It is small on the inside, a narrow straight corridor with, I believe, nine table, most of them two seaters, and while it has no big budget decorations, it is completely inviting and welcoming. It just feels right inside, a combination of old mining photos and 1940's country, a bare floor and a huge bar with completely open kitchen area to chat with the cooks while imbibing. We have consistently had great service when eating here, the waiters and waitresses are always very friendly and talkative, it's a fun place to be. \nThe food is top notch and super cheap, you can leave totally full and pay less than ten bucks, incredible. We have probably been here a couple dozen times and I have tried a large majority of the menu and have not found a pasty I didn't enjoy yet. Kristen's favorites are the Italian, which is pepperoni, salami, ham, mozzarella, basil and tomatoes with a marinara dipping sauce and the Pilgrim, which is turkey, sweet potatoes, grilled onions, stuffing and a red wine gravy, and I can attest, they are both delicious. My favorites are the Mexican, which is spiced steak strips, potatoes, eggs, hatch chilies and cheddar with a side of sour cream and the Shepard's Pie, which is lamb, peas, carrots, grilled onions, mashed potatoes and cheddar with a side of gravy, these are both like heaven in your mouth. And if you enjoy the occasional beer, Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar is my favorite and they have it on tap, they actually have a pretty good selection of brews. \n    If you have not tried the Cornish Pasty Company yet, you are doing yourself a great disservice, you can stop by today and get a cold beer a warm pasty and a full stomach for well under twenty bucks.

            "text": "It has been a LONG TIME since I have been to this place, but I would love to put my 10 cents in.  First off, before eating here I didn't even know meat pies existed.  It was like an awesome burrito but with a flaky crust and WAY more choices.  When I lived in Tempe I was a terribly picky eater and every single time I came in I got the same thing, the meatball pasty.  It was awesome, everytime.  Everything on the menu looks delicious and it looks like the flavors blend together very well.  They are premade before you get there, so you cant really have them take ingredients out, although I am sure if you let them know ahead of time it can be arranged.\n\nSo there are 2 things I would like to talk about here.  First, the atmosphere.  Walking in you have a tiny restaurant that has a bar on one side and some small tables against the wall.  All the waiters are tatted up and lend an air of ruggedness to the joint.  As you sit at the bar, they are right in front of you rolling up the pasties and behind them are the stoves that they bake your pies in after you order them.  So basically you are sitting at a bar, drinking a cold beer and you can feel the heat from the ovens.  In some places this would be annoying, but again I feel like it lends greatness to the atmosphere.  The music is usually some good British rock and once again, yes, lends to the atmosphere.  So I enjoy feeling like I am in some tiny pub in Cornwall.\n\nSecond, THE DESSERT!  I will start with the Strawberry Pavlova which I could have done without.  The meringue shell is light and unless that is your cup of tea, keep on reading.  The PB&J pasty I only had one time and it was good, but second rate for me compared to the next two items.  Next up is the caramel apple pasty.  Delish!  Apple and caramel baked into the pie shell and topped with ice cream.  However nothing in this world can touch the BANOFFEE Pie!  Dig this real quick, a thick graham cracker pie crust.  Top that with caramel.  Top that with whipped cream and top that with bananas.  Oh, and if you are crazy ask them for strawberries too...and ice cream.  Now eat that and tell me you've had a better dessert.  I sure as hell havent!",

Any foodie knows there is more to a restaurant experience than a great product. An amazing restaurant has three basics covered:1) customer service 2) great food offerings 3) an overall great experience. This place lacks customer service which kills the experience. I stood there on a packed Tuesday and saw 3-5 different employees walk by with no acknowledgement that I existed. No eye contact, no greeting, no words at all! After 10 mins and a line out the door I left irritated and ticked. \n\nI sympathize with the youth movement and the college atmosphere this place has, however customer service needs to be emphasized to the men and women working the floor. They are the face of your store and if this trend continues, eventually customers will get fed up and go elsewhere. If I am an owner I would be pissed if this negative behavior was going on in my business. The business acumen is very important and should be a learning tool to teach the college kids the important lessons which can be applied to all different job titles. The staff I saw working tonight looked lazy and tired. Maybe due to the high temperature of the restaurant however with poor customer service and lack of a face in the entrance greeting me with a smile and a friendly greeting, it leaves me feeling like you don't want my money and you don't care enough about your customers standing around. Eventually the attitude of we have a superior product that ppl pay for and they not have to worry about customer service will come back to bite them in the butt.\n\n\nAreas for improvement\n\nThe waiters should be focused on turning tables and getting the checks as soon as the dessert is finished as opposed to walking around with their heads cut off. More tables being turned equates to more tips. I saw 4-6 tables sitting talking on their phone when they could have been served their checks or ordered more food. My avg time from start to finish was between 90-120 mins! You cut my time in the restaurant to 60 mins with efficient service and food running from the kitchen this place could double its profits and increase tips. \n\nThey need someone to work the front and greet the customers and let them know they are wanted, appreciated and they want to provide me with a great meal! \n\nDrinks out in under 5 mins from order (I waited 20 mins and she forgot about my 2nd beer later in the evening and I had to remind her so 30 mins for a pint of beer...total wait time for 2 drinks: 50 mins\n\nNotification on food times (depends on who is working) \n\nChallenge your servers to turn tables faster \n\nServers need to be smiling and social",

I was introduced to pasties on my trip to Michigan last November and had them a few times there and I will tell  you the one I had here was way better than any I had there!  Perfect crust, perfect mixture inside--I just wish I lived near, or that they would open a branch in San Diego area!  I got the lamb and mint pastie and it had a mild but distinct lamb flavor (sometimes I order lamb dishes that just taste like beef so I appreciated this) mixed with the veggies and mint.  Very Delicious.  I would have loved to try a dessert but I was too full and had no frig in my motel to take leftovers back to. The waiters and waitresses were all very friendly, too.

We waited a few minutes and were able to get two chairs at the bar. If you're sitting at the bar, you're essentially in the open kitchen as well. Like I said, it's very small! We had an awkward few minutes at the bar (sitting in front of people's empty plates), but someone finally gave us menus. \n\nWe ordered draft beer - Rogue Hazelnut Brown, which happens to be one of our favorites. I've never seen it on tap before, so we were pretty excited to try it. It did not disappoint! We ordered our pasties; I had the bangers and mash and my husband had the chicken tikka masala. I think we'd agree that they were both good, but nothing mind-blowing.  My husband is from England and thought the sausages didn't taste authentic. They were extremely sage-y and a bit tough. I was a bit disappointed that the \"mash\" was really just chunks of potatoes. The red wine gravy served on the side was good. \n\nI think it was a bit pricey for what we got - two pasties and two beers for $28. I wouldn't make a special trip to Tempe to have it again.",

            "text": "Who doesn't like pastries??? And savory pastries, much less. An 'Oggie', is the classic pasty that is still savored in Cornwall and all over the UK today. After hearing so many locals rave about the famous pastry, I had to pay the Cornish Pastry Company a visit. Talk about a British pub. This place mimics the dark, mysterious alley pubs in England. The restaurant is dim, moody and spacious with pool tables, a huge bar area and a misted patio. The vibe was very mellow on a weekday afternoon, but I can imagine it gets fairly busy on the weekends. After studying the extensive list of pastries (over two dozen), I went with the Carne Adovada from the premium list and the Cajun Chicken from the signature list and a side of the the broccoli cauliflower bake.\n\nThe broccoli cauliflower bake was delivered first. Think: healthy take on mac and cheese without giving up any of the flavor. The broccoli cauliflower dish was swimming in this wonderful cheese sauce and baked with tons of cheese on top creating a perfectly crisp exterior. Definitely delicious and a must order. \n\nThe pastries came next. Similar to a calzone but a lot less doughy, and a lot more flakey; the dough recipe is perfect because it is not overpowering to the savory delicious fillings. The Adovada was filled with simmered pork in New Mexican red chili stew, Mexican rice, hatch chilies and cheddar with a side of sour cream and salsa (the sides are switched in the photos). The pork was so tender and flavorful and the stew and chilies added a perfect kick. This was a British take on a Mexican influenced dish and it was a winner. The Cajun Chicken was filled with spicy cajun chicken breast, bacon, ham and Swiss and served with a side of chipotle sauce. The chicken was tender and the bacon added the right amount of smokiness paired with the chipotle sauce. I enjoyed this pastry as well, but the Adovada was the winner.\n\nWith so many options to choose from, you really can't go wrong here. I spend about fifteen minutes on the menu trying to decide which pasty to choose. There is something for everyone here with flavors ranging form Spanish influence, to Indian influence, to Mediterranean influence. The service was on point as well. We were directed to the main seating area by the host and the waitress took time to point out some of her favorites on the menu. She didn't seem to be very knowledgable on what each pasty included and the sauces were switched on my pastries, but all was forgiven after the first bite. There is a large private parking lot for the restaurant with free parking available. I'll be back next time I'm in town.",

A slight step up from a hole in the wall type of place, this quaint spot serves up good, tasty, and satisfying food hot from the kitchen.\n\nWhat is a pasty?\n\nA pasty's history can be associated with the tin miners in England.  The story goes that these miners were covered head to toe in dust and other nasty stuff and would eat these calzone like dishes as a means to have nourishment without the need to return to the surface.  Supposedly, the miners were able to eat the pastry like food by holding onto the \"handles\" and when done, discard the tainted remains into the mine thereby appeasing the spirits that haunted the mines.\n\nAt the Cornish Pasty Co. I can first hand recommend the Chicken Pesto.  Very good flavoring and filling.  Or you can go with the more traditional route with beef, potatoes, and swede.  The sauces that come with your pasty are there to accent the flavors and are highly recommend to try as well.\n\nPros\n* Good food\n* Originality\n* Portions\n* Customer service\n* Coat hooks at the bar\n\nCons\n* Small interior",

I would suggest to call ahead and order before eating there. I can understand the high price for just one pasty (around $9 per pastey not including a side) because they make each one by hand with fresh ingredients. The restaurant can work on the interior design as its a bit confusing, a mix between modern and old style English pub.

It's pronounced \"pass-tee.\" \n\nPasties are a traditional lunch food for miners from Cornwall in the UK. They go back hundreds of years, and you can read the menu to learn all about that. Dean, the founder, head chef and all-around professor of pasties, will be happy to add even more, being the good Cornish lad he is. \n\nNow, there are a bunch of things I like about CoPaCo. First, the pasties range from the traditional to the totally off-the-wall. The recipes are so varied, from the Royal with Cheese to the Lamb Vindaloo and the Lovely Bit of Salmon, that I can't even pick a favorite. If I go there 10 different times, I'll eat ten different pasties. They're hand-made each day, including the dough. The kitchen crew at this place proves humans built the pyramids - these guys work their tales off keeping the pasties coming, and they make Amish barn raisers look lazy.\n\nSecond, it's just a fun place. There's usually good, hard rock 'n' roll playing over the sound system. It's a place where you can have some ribald antics and loud laughter and nobody cares. It's laid-back and unpretentious. The staff is courteous, though they can get a bit harried during the busy hours. But they'll always try their hardest and be friendly.\n\nThird, there are some great desserts. The bonofee pie (graham cracker crust, whipped cream, bananas, caramel!) is my favorite.\n\nWhat could be better? Eh, I'd ditch the taps that disgorge Kronenburg 1664 and Hoegaarden and drop in a fewer higher-octane brews. In the meantime, the cooler is full of bottled selections. The Skull Splitter is awesome!\n\nKeep in mind that even though I gave it five stars, this is not a fancy, high-falutin' sort of place. It's absolutely perfect for what it is: a fun place to gather with your hooligan sidekicks, eat creative twists on the Cornish pasty and listen to some rock music. Brilliant!",

The atmosphere is okay, but I prefer the feel of the Scottsdale and Mesa locations, this one is just the closest to me.\n\nSome of my favorites include the Potato Leak Soup (best I've had anywhere), and the following pasties... The Mexican (vegetarian version is good too), Lamb Vindaloo (it's a little spicy), and the Carne Adovada.... I've haven't had anything that was outright bad, but the Royal had way more onion than I care for, and I also didn't care for The Italian either which was way too close to a calzone, but the difference in a pasty crust wasn't my taste.\n\nAll said, pretty much everyone can find something to like here... fair warning, it is definitely not a carb friendly menu.. there are a few salads which are good, but it's not their mainstay.",

It is small on the inside, a narrow straight corridor with, I believe, nine table, most of them two seaters, and while it has no big budget decorations, it is completely inviting and welcoming. It just feels right inside, a combination of old mining photos and 1940's country, a bare floor and a huge bar with completely open kitchen area to chat with the cooks while imbibing. We have consistently had great service when eating here, the waiters and waitresses are always very friendly and talkative, it's a fun place to be. \nThe food is top notch and super cheap, you can leave totally full and pay less than ten bucks, incredible. We have probably been here a couple dozen times and I have tried a large majority of the menu and have not found a pasty I didn't enjoy yet. Kristen's favorites are the Italian, which is pepperoni, salami, ham, mozzarella, basil and tomatoes with a marinara dipping sauce and the Pilgrim, which is turkey, sweet potatoes, grilled onions, stuffing and a red wine gravy, and I can attest, they are both delicious. My favorites are the Mexican, which is spiced steak strips, potatoes, eggs, hatch chilies and cheddar with a side of sour cream and the Shepard's Pie, which is lamb, peas, carrots, grilled onions, mashed potatoes and cheddar with a side of gravy, these are both like heaven in your mouth. And if you enjoy the occasional beer, Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar is my favorite and they have it on tap, they actually have a pretty good selection of brews. \n    If you have not tried the Cornish Pasty Company yet, you are doing yourself a great disservice, you can stop by today and get a cold beer a warm pasty and a full stomach for well under twenty bucks.

Let's just say their limited space is used very efficiently.

The Tempe location is tucked in the corner of a dingy mall far out of the Mill Ave nightlife.  There is barely a sign on the building, the windows are painted dark black with an old photo mural theme, the door leads into a narrow black corridor with no greeter.  It looks like a bar with a few 2-person tables and that's all ... until you accidentally discover that the bar (with barstools) is actually a \"kitchen\" with no alcohol and that if you wend your way around the end of the bar, passing the restrooms, you will find the actual dining room and drinking bar.  We ate in the kitchen/bar and only later happened upon that discovery and that there is second equally dark and foreboding door that goes to the main dining room.\n\nThe employees seemed to all guys, with a distinct aura of all being bikers, but they were super-friendly and acceptably attentive.  Assuming the food is made from scratch, the 20 - 30 minute wait to be served was also acceptable.  You can pass the time enjoying an excellent selection of draft and bottled beers.\n\nAt $6.50, my Oggie pasty was a good value.  The crust was tender and flakey and the meat was tasty.  I learned from this my first experience with rutabaga that I am not a fan of rutabaga, but that's not their fault. The amount of filling was roughly what you get in one of those tiny 99 cent pot pies in the frozen food section of the supermarket.  The brown-wine gravy was yummy.\n\nThe place sends a confusing message. It absolutely looks like a college dive (and I probably would be there all the time if I attended ASU) but it's quite a hike from campus. It's not Scottsdale funky (yea!!), and if you are wearing anything fancier than a tee shirt and jeans you would definitely feel out of place.  It's a curiously quiet place, none of the ribaldry you would find at an Irish pub (the canned music was mostly soft rock of the 70's and 80's).\n\nBottom line - it's rare to find a good pasty in this area, and these are good.

I am always attempting different pasties everytime I come. And every single one has been great so far.  Hubby had the Cajun Chicken and that was good.\n\nTheir pasties run from $8-9.50.  You get a nice portion size and if you really feel like sharing you can do with one.  But I recommend getting your own and doing a nice switch with one half of your pasty.  Much more fun that way and worth the calories!\n\nIt has expanded since the last time I was there.  So if you walk in and see that cramped area where they do all the cooking; keep walking and you will see that it opens up to a nice spacious area.  We learned the hard way.

Where do you want to go?\" It is a bit tucked away in a little strip mall, so I'm going to chalk it up to location and not the fact that I typically have the memory of a gnat.\n\nIf you've never had a pasty (pronounced pah-stee, unlike the pay-stee nipple adhesives strippers wear), you're missing out on a hearty English Hot Pocket. However, likening it to a Hot Pocket does it a disservice. Hot Pockets consist of cardboard crust filled with nuclear hot goo that causes blisters and cursing, rather than sighs of content and delight. While both are great drunk/hangover food, the Cornish Pasty Co. far surpasses the measly freezer dried Hot Pocket. \n\nWhile they have flavors that are also available as Hot Pocket varieties (taste test!), my dining partner routinely reminds me that he will shun me for indulge in one of those. Not that it's hard to find at least five different flavors that you could imagine chowing down. I always end up just blurting out my decision at the last minute to end my indecisiveness. They updated the menu recently and it now includes a bunch of flavors that weren't previously available, like carne adovada. Mmm. So if you haven't been here in a while, give it another go and try something new.\n\nFor about seven bucks you get a huge, stick-to-your-ribs pastry filled with a wide variety of meats and vegetables. I've never tried the vegetarian choices, but there are quite a few on the menu (about half as many as the non-vegetarian options). Among the traditional pasties, you can't go wrong with the oggie, shepards pie or lamb and mint. I've tried the chicken tikka masala, greek chicken, and lamb vindaloo from the fancy schmancy options and they were just as stellar. The greek salad is also pretty respectable, with a hefty amount of kalamata olives and feta cheese. \n\nWatching the cooks at work is part of the fun at this place, so have a seat at the bar. Just make sure to do so far enough away from the oven that you won't end up dried out like beef jerky at the end of your meal. When you get the bill, there's a cashier near the door that you can cash out at if you're in a hurry, since the servers are a little bit on the slow side. Slow, laid back, whatever. \n\nTheir happy hour is also an awesome option to opt for, and is offered every day from 3 to 5 pm. There's a dollar off beers, three dollar Irish car bombs and two dollar top shelf shots (Ketel One vodka, Jameson whiskey, etc.), so if you're looking to spend an afternoon getting stinko and munching on some awesome food, this is the place to be.\n\nUPDATE: I've tried just about every non-veggie pasty on the menu. The salmon trumps them all. Do it.",

This one is closer to me, so this is the one I go to, but if you are looking to have a large group, you may wish to go to the Mesa location.\n\n   That said, I really like this one. The mood is very raw, because of the small size, even at a table you can see the cooks behind the bar, hear the clatter and clang of the kitchen. That said, you can still have conversations here without issue; you just have a bit of background noise.\n\n   The food, though...the food is spectacular. Seriously, look at that menu, look at those pictures. The first time I was there I had the chicken tikka masala pasty. Not as good chicken tikka as a straight up Indian restaurant, of course, but still phenomenal, and the pasty just made it that much better. I also snagged the bananoffee pie. It could easily provide dessert for two people; I ate the whole thing. It was just that good. Not too sweet, very banana-y...\n\n   Eat here. It's really that simple. \n\n   Also, as a tip, there's a parking lot 'round the back that is usually not full, unlike the one on the front. And, though the address is off of University Drive, the front is really facing Hardy. Threw me a bit the first time I was looking for it.",

I have tried the lamb and mint, bangers and mash, and pesto chicken.  All are tasty, but I really recommend the bangers and mash.  The sausage and mash potatoes went really well together.  Really, you can never go wrong with mash potatoes.  The sitting area is very small, but the bar can be an interesting option since you get to see the cooks at work.  I usually go for lunch, so I cannot speak to their beer selection.  That would certainly go well with a pasty though...  Keep your eyes peeled when going there for the first time.  It is easy to miss!  I usually pull into the parking lot from Hardy Dr off University.  The restaurant is facing Hardy.",

Most of the time I sit at the bar, and the cooks make up for what the servers may lack in conversation or banter. I like that the cooks have a tip box too, that way I can hook it up if the food or cooks go above and beyond which is most every time. I'm scared to go to the other Cornish pasty because I'm afraid it won't compare... It looks a little too clean and contemporary and in my experience the original is always the best. Not a ton of people know about it, so it's great to take first timers there. The menu is vast, unique, and offers plenty for every taste.

After ordering and waiting on our drinks I had decided to just leave because of the music but was presently surprised that after asking the waitresses to turn the music down, she did with a smile. I guess they prefer a total BAR atmosphere ! After surveying the menu for 15 minutes I decided on the Philly Cheese Steak Pastie and my friend went traditional with the Shepherds Pie.\nLet me say we were NOT disappointed, the Pasties were fresh and yummy delicious, mine came with a mustard cream sauce as well as their red wine gravy that I had asked for. I prefer the gravy ! My friends Shepherds Pie with Lamb and the wine gravy was also yummy. After a short walk around I was surprised to see all of these wonderful pie's were being made FRESH behind a short order/bar environment. Yes just like we used to see in the drug stores, a griddle and gas fired 4 burner stove and a tiny convection oven If you've never had a pastie, its basically like a calzone but uses a pastry crust. There were over 25 different variations with several great looking desserts, we decided on the homemade bread pudding, more chocolate brownie tasting then traditional bread pudding, but tasty all the same.\nThere prices were fair for the Tempe area, $9.50 and $9.75 respectively and the bread pudding was $7.50.\nI am looking forward to dining there again when they are not out of their homemade sausage.\nIf you don't care for a Bar atmosphere, loud music, dark and dingy then you should steer clear or set outside.\nI should add that I found it extremely odd that they used old church pews for a large part of their seating.",

I was introduced to pasties on my trip to Michigan last November and had them a few times there and I will tell  you the one I had here was way better than any I had there!  Perfect crust, perfect mixture inside--I just wish I lived near, or that they would open a branch in San Diego area!  I got the lamb and mint pastie and it had a mild but distinct lamb flavor (sometimes I order lamb dishes that just taste like beef so I appreciated this) mixed with the veggies and mint.  Very Delicious.  I would have loved to try a dessert but I was too full and had no frig in my motel to take leftovers back to. The waiters and waitresses were all very friendly, too.

One side is a bar scene with pool and other games (briefly walked through); the other side was the restaurant. They have booths, tables and 'breakfast nooks'; host told us to sit wherever. \n\nService:\nA few different people approached us throughout our dining experience and all were nice. Two were very attentive, but one first forgot the lemon for our waters and didn't ask if I wanted more water each time she approached (so I asked since my cup was empty and sitting at the edge of the table - I thought this was the unspoken universal signal for 'please refill me' but perhaps she's new to serving lol). \n\nMenu:\nVery clear and not busy. I like that cuz some menus need to be revamped. So many choices, but I narrowed it down to four pastries quickly based on what I prefer. The Porky, Italian, All Day English Breakfast and the Lamb & Mint. I opted for the latter and overall was happy with my selection (one of my friends also went for this one and she liked it). \n\nFood:\nCame out warm and smelling delicious (of course I had to snap it first). I wanted to try it without the sauce and it was good, but not tasty. Adding the Red Wine Gravy made it very tasty so it makes sense there's not too much flavor before adding it (ate 1/2 with this gravy). My other friend was having one of the steak ones and his came with Peppercorn Brandy Cream Sauce so I asked for a side for my second half. Sooooo good! I did try a bite of the blue cheese steak pastry he had and very tasty to me, but you must love blue cheese if ordering that one FYI otherwise they said it's too overbearing (perfect for me and blue cheese lovers tho). \n\nRestroom: \nNot very pretty in there, but I wouldn't expect it to be in a hipster dive type bar. The stalls were not painted by an artist, lol, but the bright color choice was a good try. I hope all the graffiti was written when there wasn't a line since there's only two stalls. I'm thinking AZ doesn't have the law enforcing toilet seat covers. They had toilet paper, soap, working toilets (oh wait one out of the two was out of order), and running water...so that's really all that matters I suppose. The owner had a sweet long note pulled from Facebook on the wall (it was thanking the community/customers for their continued support) and I would have taken a pic, but left my phone back at the booth. \n\nOverall it was a good experience so I tipped well and didn't have leftovers.",

I remember the first time we went after hearing about it here on Yelp, we ended up leaving with the 'ole \"where have you been my whole life\" feeling. This place is awesome. \n    The Cornish Pasty is located on the side of a very random and small strip mall, if you didn't know you were looking for it you would probably not even notice it. It is small on the inside, a narrow straight corridor with, I believe, nine table, most of them two seaters, and while it has no big budget decorations, it is completely inviting and welcoming. It just feels right inside, a combination of old mining photos and 1940's country, a bare floor and a huge bar with completely open kitchen area to chat with the cooks while imbibing. We have consistently had great service when eating here, the waiters and waitresses are always very friendly and talkative, it's a fun place to be. \nThe food is top notch and super cheap, you can leave totally full and pay less than ten bucks, incredible. We have probably been here a couple dozen times and I have tried a large majority of the menu and have not found a pasty I didn't enjoy yet. Kristen's favorites are the Italian, which is pepperoni, salami, ham, mozzarella, basil and tomatoes with a marinara dipping sauce and the Pilgrim, which is turkey, sweet potatoes, grilled onions, stuffing and a red wine gravy, and I can attest, they are both delicious. My favorites are the Mexican, which is spiced steak strips, potatoes, eggs, hatch chilies and cheddar with a side of sour cream and the Shepard's Pie, which is lamb, peas, carrots, grilled onions, mashed potatoes and cheddar with a side of gravy, these are both like heaven in your mouth. And if you enjoy the occasional beer, Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar is my favorite and they have it on tap, they actually have a pretty good selection of brews. \n    If you have not tried the Cornish Pasty Company yet, you are doing yourself a great disservice, you can stop by today and get a cold beer a warm pasty and a full stomach for well under twenty bucks. You having nothing to lose.",

When we got there it was really dark inside, almost like a throw back 70s lounge feel, especially with the music they played. We were told to sit anywhere. Our server was Sarah who was absolutely wonderful. She was really on the ball, a great server, and anticipated our needs in advance. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Salad, my friend got the Porky pasty. Our food came in a rather timely fashion despite it being a very busy Friday dinner rush. I enjoyed the salad, the portion was huge. The chicken was tasty and there was plenty of tomatoes, cukes and dressing (on the side). My friend really enjoyed the Porky and even took some home, as it was quite a lot. I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical of this place when we first walked in. The darkness really didn't convey fun and friendly but the service was great and so was the food so it more than made up for the initial shock I felt upon arriving. Sarah, keep being awesome, all servers could take a lesson from this gal.",

If you're planning on staying a while to enjoy the brand new patio (with heaters and misters), I would recommend getting an extra large glass. 32 ounces of fun. \n\nNext, go ahead and get yourself a cup of one of their awesome soups. Personal favorite: Red Pepper. Spicy, fresh, and delicious. If soup isn't your thing, I would recommend the oven chips -- oven-cooked french fries with cracked pepper. Definitely add the jalapeno. \n\nFor the main course, obviously a pasty is the way to go. My favorites include The Mexican (spiced steak strips, eggs, potatoes, jalapenos), The Royale with Cheese (hamburger, french fries, grilled onions, bacon, cheddar/swiss blend), and the Chicken Pot Pie (chicken, carrots, red potato, green beans, celery). \n\nFinish your meal off with a class Cornish Pasty desert: The Banoffee Pie.

I remember the first time we went after hearing about it here on Yelp, we ended up leaving with the 'ole \"where have you been my whole life\" feeling. This place is awesome. \n    The Cornish Pasty is located on the side of a very random and small strip mall, if you didn't know you were looking for it you would probably not even notice it. It is small on the inside, a narrow straight corridor with, I believe, nine table, most of them two seaters, and while it has no big budget decorations, it is completely inviting and welcoming. It just feels right inside, a combination of old mining photos and 1940's country, a bare floor and a huge bar with completely open kitchen area to chat with the cooks while imbibing. We have consistently had great service when eating here, the waiters and waitresses are always very friendly and talkative, it's a fun place to be. \nThe food is top notch and super cheap, you can leave totally full and pay less than ten bucks, incredible. We have probably been here a couple dozen times and I have tried a large majority of the menu and have not found a pasty I didn't enjoy yet. Kristen's favorites are the Italian, which is pepperoni, salami, ham, mozzarella, basil and tomatoes with a marinara dipping sauce and the Pilgrim, which is turkey, sweet potatoes, grilled onions, stuffing and a red wine gravy, and I can attest, they are both delicious. My favorites are the Mexican, which is spiced steak strips, potatoes, eggs, hatch chilies and cheddar with a side of sour cream and the Shepard's Pie, which is lamb, peas, carrots, grilled onions, mashed potatoes and cheddar with a side of gravy, these are both like heaven in your mouth. And if you enjoy the occasional beer, Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar is my favorite and they have it on tap, they actually have a pretty good selection of brews. \n    If you have not tried the Cornish Pasty Company yet, you are doing yourself a great disservice, you can stop by today and get a cold beer a warm pasty and a full stomach for well under twenty bucks.

The restaurant is dim, moody and spacious with pool tables, a huge bar area and a misted patio. The vibe was very mellow on a weekday afternoon, but I can imagine it gets fairly busy on the weekends.

At the end of the 3rd day, I had seen enough food to feed the LSU National champion football team.  I could out fast Les or Bear on their survivor shows\n\nDinner time was approaching.....My business associate and I couldn't face a full course dinner for at least another 24 hours...but we knew we had to eat something so we wouldnt wake up at 3 am famished.  I remembers reading about this place in Yelp that would be perfect for our situation....so remembering some favorable Yelp reviews in Phoenix  I said to him:\n\n\"How about pastys for dinner?\"\n\nHe went from a relaxed and carefree disposition to a stunned and shocked demeanor.   He looked me like I was from another planet and his glance indicated doubt about my integrity.   Then with a delayed but dry smile he spoke up and said....\n\n\"Aren't those things they wear at the.....\"\n\n\"NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!    Not pasties......pastys.\"   I retorted quickly before the people in the lobby heard the next nouns he was just about to utter.   \"Pasty's with a short vowel, not long.   Have you ever had one.?\"\n\nStill thinking of the long vowel version, he hesitated a little and answered with a \"No\" veiled with a lot of doubt and concern.\n\n\"Good.   That's where we're going.\"    As I glanced over to him, I could see a sense of curiousity, dispair and expectation of upcoming chaos.\n\nWe arrived at 7:45 pm.   It's dark everywhere.   In the street, in the parking lot.   We enter the restaurant and it's no brighter.   \n\nIt is a very narrow and long restaurant with just enough room for seats at the bar nearly the length of the store and small side tables on the side.  The interior decoration theme is obvious here.   Build the biggest bar that would fit in this row house type of store, and accessorize the rest of the restaurant around the bar.  \n\nSitting in a very dark restaurant, with Beatle music blaring away, this English pub type of place had a huge variety of pastys....from traditional steak and potatoes, to bangers and mash, to more contempory selections that include vegetarian, curries, and fish.   They have a huge selection of international beers, many of which are of the UK......duhhh.\n\nI wanted to eat \"light\" so I selected the Lovely Bit a Salmon which is\nAtlantic Salmon in a white wine cream & dill sauce, sauted asparagus, spinach, roasted red potatoes, spinach and roasted tomatoes. \n\nWHAT A GREAT DISH.   Everything was layered carefully inside the pasty which was served cut in half.  The salmon was cooked perfectly.  The asparagus was not over cooked but had a crunch.   All the flavors blended well together.   I still wasn't hungry so I took one half of it back to the hotel....and had it for breakfast the following morning......which tasted just great.\n\nMy buddy had Spicy Asiago Chicken which was spicy chicken, roasted corn, black beans, asiago cheese, hatch chilies, and Mexican stewed tomatoes with a side of sour cream & salsa.   That too was excellent.\n\nIf ever in Phoenix, this would be worth any drive to have lunch or dinner and a beer.\n\nAfter dinner I asked him if he would return to eat here and he said he readily would.    Then I detected a slight pause and a curl of a smile in the background.........maybe he was fantasizing buying a long vowel...",

The Pilgrim on the other hand is like that delicious meal you make the day after Thanksgiving with all the leftovers. It has turkey, stuffing, and sweet potatoes. It's delicious by itself but with the wine gravy and cranberry sauce it's become out of this world! It's like what a chicken pot pie wishes it could be and you'll be thinking about that wine gravy sauce at Thanksgiving wishing you had some. \n\nLastly, for dessert, and no meal at Cornish Pasty Co. can be complete without it, the chocolate bread pudding. Now you may be saying \"But Connor, I've had bread pudding and I don't like it.\" That's fine. It's literally like no other bread pudding. For starters I'm fairly certain the \"bread\" they use is cake. Secondly it's not cooked into a complete mush or gel. The layers of delicious sweet cake are clearly evident when you get it. About four layers on each one typed with creme anglaise and ice cream. Each bite is incredible.",

I was looking for a place to grab some good food and a couple beers before a concert so I checked out Yelp and it did not lead me astray.\n\nTo me, a place like this is why Yelp needs to exist.  It was not in the most obvious location and when the group I was with went to walk in the front door we almost didn't know we were in the right place.  Let's just say their limited space is used very efficiently.  For what this place lacks in size, it makes up in character.\n\nInside it was kind of dark with some chairs lining the bar long the open kitchen and on the other wall a few small tables.  We found our spot in the back which was probably the only table big enough for 6 people.  The place was full and the noise level was just right; busy, but comfortable to have some lively dinner conversation. (Especially after some Irish Car Bombs.)\n\nTheir draft beer selection stuck to the UK theme with a lot of beers from that region.  I was especially surprised to see some Strongbow Cider.  They also had a few good micro brews from places like Firestone and Rogue.  Between that selection and the 32 oz. monster glasses they'd serve it in, this place was already a winner.\n\nMost importantly, their food was excellent.  I had the TIki Masala pasty and my wife had the Chicken Greek.  The Tiki Masala would be a great dish served by itself in an Indian restaurant.  Put it in a pasty and it's game over.  I tasted my wife's Chicken Greek which I probably wouldn't have picked as one of my own top choices to order and it was awesome.\n\nWe unanimously agreed this place was great and we had a laugh about some review around here that compared it to a Hot Pocket.  LOL.  I'll have to save that one under, \"Knowing about good food - FAIL!\"",

Thankfully, Cornish Pasty is lacking tassels and the like, simply serving up deliciously magical pockets filled with wonderful themed concoctions.  \n\nMy personal favorite is the reuben, where the pastrami and corned beef is tender, juicy and chewy at the same time, the buttery crust is perfectly flaky, and the 1000 Island dressing is something I enjoy smothering everything in.  I don't know that I've had a reuben in the valley that's comparable to how amazing this pasty is.  And the oven chips?  Forget about it!  Not that you need a side with the size of the pasties...Oh, the Apple Caramel Pasty is also pretty top notch for dessert - warm and gooey.\n\nTheir craft beer selection is also admirable, with a few local drafts (including Four Peaks and Oak Creek) and plenty of English-themed brews and English IPAs.  Full disclosure: as a beer geek, I only wish they didn't serve the beer in a frosted glass...it kinda affects the flavor.  Besides that, there is nothing I can complain about, especially since they recently expanded into the building next door, thus gaining about 5X the seating and space.  Much more comfortable, less claustrophobic, and easier to get around.",

Came here with some friends and my camera, and wanted to share a photo I took of the wonderful, dimly lit interior. The lighting sets the tone for an intimate, relaxed hang with your friends. \n\nThe beer selection is always kept interesting with their 5 rotating taps, one being local. The standards on tap are always good, but their cocktails are worth the deviation. \n\nI now live out of state, but every time I come home, Cornish off Hardy is on my top spots to hit while in town.

Obviously not leaving without dessert and having already enjoyed the sticky toffee pudding and bread pudding on my prior visit this time we opted for the house-special Banoffee Pie and Caramel Apple Pasty, neither as good as the pair off puddings but both better than the vast majority of in-house pastries at restaurants in Phoenix and Scottsdale (where even top tier restaurants choose to outsource their desserts to Ms. Dempsey.)",

The place is very hipster, dark and packed. It definitely seems like a Sherlock holmes, batman night out. \n\nThere are days when I crave for their Mushroom soup. Its one of the best soup i have had. They have creamy, walnut filled mushroom soup, served with house made bread and heaps of butter. You will never get tired of their bread. Cream of tomato with croutons is good too. We generally order Tandoori wings for our appetizer, which is cooked to perfection, not spicy and served with celery and ranch. When it comes to pasty, they are the boss. Their Lamb vidaloo, Chicken tikka masala brings out the complete flavor in a pasty form. The filling is delicious and their pasty, so soft made of complete butter just melts in the mouth, baked till crisp golden from the outside . One can eat just the plain pasty and crave for more. Spicy Asiago chicken and chicken pot pie are our next options. Please save room for desert, each ones unique but Apple caramel pasty you will not be disappointed.\n\nThey have a wide range of options and this place is definitely heaven for vegans too. The service is really good and you will find a lot of young hip crowd. The price is definitely reasonable and a great place to hangout with groups. I will keep visiting this place.",

With an incredible beer selection, nice and friendly wait staff, and incredible food, the Pasty is one of my favorite places in Tempe, hands down. \n\nTo start, get yourself one of the many awesome beers they have on tap. If you're planning on staying a while to enjoy the brand new patio (with heaters and misters), I would recommend getting an extra large glass. 32 ounces of fun. \n\nNext, go ahead and get yourself a cup of one of their awesome soups. Personal favorite: Red Pepper. Spicy, fresh, and delicious. If soup isn't your thing, I would recommend the oven chips -- oven-cooked french fries with cracked pepper. Definitely add the jalapeno. \n\nFor the main course, obviously a pasty is the way to go. My favorites include The Mexican (spiced steak strips, eggs, potatoes, jalapenos), The Royale with Cheese (hamburger, french fries, grilled onions, bacon, cheddar/swiss blend), and the Chicken Pot Pie (chicken, carrots, red potato, green beans, celery). \n\nFinish your meal off with a class Cornish Pasty desert: The Banoffee Pie. Graham cracker crust, homemade caramel with bananas, and whipped cream... If you're not melting already you should get to a past shoppe ASAP. \n\n5/5 for incredible atmosphere, food, staff, and overall experience. HIGHLY recommend.",

We went to the Tempe location which is a lot farther away from home than the Mesa location.   But that doesn't matter because the drive is always worth it.  I like this location because it is the original.  \nThis time I decided to skip the appetizer to save room for dessert.  I still had the usual very large Hoegaarden to start and ordered the very new and not on the menu \"Spicy BBQ Chicken Pasty\". Anything with spicy and BBQ deserves a shot and it was delicious.  \nThe chicken was tender and juicy, the BBQ sauce had some kick to it, the jalapeño and grilled onions were a great touch.  I am not sure yet if this may be a new favorite but if it weren't, it would be a close second.  Only one thing could make this night more perfect....well....maybe two things but I will settle for the Banoffee pie.\nIt has been a while since I had the Banoffee pie and I don't know why.  Who doesn't love graham cracker crust, homemade caramel, bananas and fresh whipped cream?  With every spoon full you get everything, the crust is incredible, the caramel is sweet, the whipped cream is delicious and the bananas are perfect.  I was only able to eat half of it so I brought the other half home with me.\nAnother perfect meal from a great place to eat, drink and be satisfied....anywho.  I know it's 7 am but I am heading to the refrigerator for the other half of my Banoffee pie.",

At the end of the 3rd day, I had seen enough food to feed the LSU National champion football team.  I could out fast Les or Bear on their survivor shows\n\nDinner time was approaching.....My business associate and I couldn't face a full course dinner for at least another 24 hours...but we knew we had to eat something so we wouldnt wake up at 3 am famished.  I remembers reading about this place in Yelp that would be perfect for our situation....so remembering some favorable Yelp reviews in Phoenix  I said to him:\n\n\"How about pastys for dinner?\"\n\nHe went from a relaxed and carefree disposition to a stunned and shocked demeanor.   He looked me like I was from another planet and his glance indicated doubt about my integrity.   Then with a delayed but dry smile he spoke up and said....\n\n\"Aren't those things they wear at the.....\"\n\n\"NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!    Not pasties......pastys.\"   I retorted quickly before the people in the lobby heard the next nouns he was just about to utter.   \"Pasty's with a short vowel, not long.   Have you ever had one.?\"\n\nStill thinking of the long vowel version, he hesitated a little and answered with a \"No\" veiled with a lot of doubt and concern.\n\n\"Good.   That's where we're going.\"    As I glanced over to him, I could see a sense of curiousity, dispair and expectation of upcoming chaos.\n\nWe arrived at 7:45 pm.   It's dark everywhere.   In the street, in the parking lot.   We enter the restaurant and it's no brighter.   \n\nIt is a very narrow and long restaurant with just enough room for seats at the bar nearly the length of the store and small side tables on the side.  The interior decoration theme is obvious here.   Build the biggest bar that would fit in this row house type of store, and accessorize the rest of the restaurant around the bar.  \n\nSitting in a very dark restaurant, with Beatle music blaring away, this English pub type of place had a huge variety of pastys....from traditional steak and potatoes, to bangers and mash, to more contempory selections that include vegetarian, curries, and fish.   They have a huge selection of international beers, many of which are of the UK......duhhh.\n\nI wanted to eat \"light\" so I selected the Lovely Bit a Salmon which is\nAtlantic Salmon in a white wine cream & dill sauce, sauted asparagus, spinach, roasted red potatoes, spinach and roasted tomatoes. \n\nWHAT A GREAT DISH.   Everything was layered carefully inside the pasty which was served cut in half.  The salmon was cooked perfectly.  The asparagus was not over cooked but had a crunch.   All the flavors blended well together.   I still wasn't hungry so I took one half of it back to the hotel....and had it for breakfast the following morning......which tasted just great.\n\nMy buddy had Spicy Asiago Chicken which was spicy chicken, roasted corn, black beans, asiago cheese, hatch chilies, and Mexican stewed tomatoes with a side of sour cream & salsa.   That too was excellent.\n\nIf ever in Phoenix, this would be worth any drive to have lunch or dinner and a beer.\n\nAfter dinner I asked him if he would return to eat here and he said he readily would.    Then I detected a slight pause and a curl of a smile in the background.........maybe he was fantasizing buying a long vowel...",

Much more fun that way and worth the calories!\n\nIt has expanded since the last time I was there.

I don't like how the building is kind of a shotgun, which is a bit picky but whatever, the food is great.\n\nI'm vegetarian and they have fake chicken and a whole vegetarian menu that has the same amazing dishes that they have for meat eaters.  And by dishes I mean pasties.  \n\nOk, so while the Pasties are basically hot pockets, they are really quite a full meal.  I've been more than once, and each time the food and service (people have talked about lax service, which I haven't ever seen) have been amazing.\n\nIt's super delicious and it feels neat to be eating something so historic.",

            "text": "Ok, I was at Lawrence Dunham Vineyards across the street for their grand opening and someone said you have to try the Cornish Pasty Company across the street. Being a big fan of Pasties and Shepherd/Cottage pie.. we gave it a try. The starter we ordered was some Vindaloo (I believe) hot wings. They were perfectly charred and still moist inside with a nice spicy kick.  \n\nThe main entree's we split were the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Cottage Pie. WOW! What a lovely treat when the mains came out. The Chickent Tikka Masala was quite spicy and moist without having so much juice that it made a huge mess. The yogurt sauce was a nice calming flavor to counteract the spicy red curry. Usually you do not get a real curry kick when you go to a restaurant so be aware that this is the real thing. It's wonderfully spicy for those of you with a low tolerance just order something else. For those of you who adore curry and wanted an easy and tasty new way to eat it here in the U.S. this is for you.  I only say that because it's not the usual dish served up in the U.S. while pies and pasties have been the norm in the UK forever.  Big hit #1\n\nThe second was the Cottage Pie (shepherds=beef / cottage=lamb)  and this is so perfect. A nice mild lamb flavor with a wonderful cheesy, potato mix that is served with a red wine gravy. You get all the moisture without having a dripping mess on your hands. So perfectly cooked, and filling. If you want a great comfort food this is the one. Don't be fooled when you see it, this is one filling meal. I had trouble finishing although I couldn't keep from eating more than my stomach told me to. Loved it from start to finish.  \n\nThe crust is nice and golden brown, not to thick but more than enough to keep everything inside. It's so flaky and perfect I have no complaints and had to write a review.  The photo I took is showing the Cottage Pie... the Chicken Tikka is the other half you can't see the inside of. The sauce is the yogurt sauce for the Tikka as it was dark and was the better sauce to show up in my photo. \n\nGive it a try..it's worth stepping a few blocks out of the usually higher traveled old town area. This is worth getting up and driving out of the way for when you want a comfortable setting with plenty of outdoor seating, a huge bar with what looked like  a lot of beer choices. I loved the feel and the crowd it just had even with the smaller early week crowd. It was definitely bringing a bit of that Urban fun and people that Scottsdale needs. Just get there and enjoy.",

Expect to sit alongside your mates and clip your bag to the bar as the place is truly tiny. Husband also got a light ale. \nRight away they wanted to take the order, but the menu is a fun adventure and as a first visit I really wanted to read all the selections. My family was starving so they just couldn't wait for me to meander over the varieties and the waitress was really eager to get moving. She said take your time, but she stood right there and so, I did feel a bit rushed. As a result I didn't order a side salad which I think would have made me happier.\nI was wondering if the Pasty was going to be enough, was it going to be soggy or burnt, was the crust going to be doughy or dry?  I mean I'm naturally a skeptical critic, why else would I Yelp? But my Pasty was perfect. It was not greasy, it was flaky but firm in the right parts, it wasn't burnt anywhere it was divine. My Pasty was not chock full of air pockets it was chock full of filling. My daughter could only eat half (she's 9) but the adults were perfectly satisfied without being bloated.\nI could bring my veggie friends/family here too.\nI knocked a star off because despite being not too busy we waited and waited to close out our check. She was too fast taking the order, and too slow to close us out. We didn't get to order any dessert because of our long wait with empty plates. Despite the unevenness of the service no one was rude or unpleasant and the pocket was so good we'll come back.  Next time I'm going to have the Reuben stuffed in there, my daughter wants to try the meatball and my husband just might have a Pilgrim (Thanksgiving in your hands! Lovely!) I know everyone can find a Pasty that they would like to eat here and I encourage you to go!\nUpdate: We did go back and have the above selections and I got a Chicken Tikka salad to share. Fabulous! I enjoyed the second visit even more. The Pilgrim is undeniably yum, the Reuben was chockfull of flavor, the meatball delighted my daughter but was so-so for me. The Indian spiced chicken was so tasty I wish they made it into a Pasty too. They do Lamb Vindaloo, so why not? I still recommend this place and will likely return a thrid time... so yummy.",

Where do you want to go?\" It is a bit tucked away in a little strip mall, so I'm going to chalk it up to location and not the fact that I typically have the memory of a gnat.\n\nIf you've never had a pasty (pronounced pah-stee, unlike the pay-stee nipple adhesives strippers wear), you're missing out on a hearty English Hot Pocket. However, likening it to a Hot Pocket does it a disservice. Hot Pockets consist of cardboard crust filled with nuclear hot goo that causes blisters and cursing, rather than sighs of content and delight. While both are great drunk/hangover food, the Cornish Pasty Co. far surpasses the measly freezer dried Hot Pocket. \n\nWhile they have flavors that are also available as Hot Pocket varieties (taste test!), my dining partner routinely reminds me that he will shun me for indulge in one of those. Not that it's hard to find at least five different flavors that you could imagine chowing down. I always end up just blurting out my decision at the last minute to end my indecisiveness. They updated the menu recently and it now includes a bunch of flavors that weren't previously available, like carne adovada. Mmm. So if you haven't been here in a while, give it another go and try something new.\n\nFor about seven bucks you get a huge, stick-to-your-ribs pastry filled with a wide variety of meats and vegetables. I've never tried the vegetarian choices, but there are quite a few on the menu (about half as many as the non-vegetarian options). Among the traditional pasties, you can't go wrong with the oggie, shepards pie or lamb and mint. I've tried the chicken tikka masala, greek chicken, and lamb vindaloo from the fancy schmancy options and they were just as stellar. The greek salad is also pretty respectable, with a hefty amount of kalamata olives and feta cheese. \n\nWatching the cooks at work is part of the fun at this place, so have a seat at the bar. Just make sure to do so far enough away from the oven that you won't end up dried out like beef jerky at the end of your meal. When you get the bill, there's a cashier near the door that you can cash out at if you're in a hurry, since the servers are a little bit on the slow side. Slow, laid back, whatever. \n\nTheir happy hour is also an awesome option to opt for, and is offered every day from 3 to 5 pm. There's a dollar off beers, three dollar Irish car bombs and two dollar top shelf shots (Ketel One vodka, Jameson whiskey, etc.), so if you're looking to spend an afternoon getting stinko and munching on some awesome food, this is the place to be.\n\nUPDATE: I've tried just about every non-veggie pasty on the menu. The salmon trumps them all. Do it.",

As a (mostly) vegetarian, I was pretty blown away by the options - I have to eat a lot of veggie burgers elsewhere - but this place has a whole vegan/vegetarian page of items, some of which include veggie chicken and beef. Forget what anyone else has said...nothing could be better than the Eggplant Parmesan pastie! ;) My sister also loved her Lamb and Mint pastie, saying it was \"effing delicious\" and that the mint was not overpowering. The pastry is not doughy like pizza crust, but rather flaky and crispy like a biscuit. The vegetables were cooked perfectly, as they were fresh and still a little crunchy. \n\nLiterally my only complaint about this place is that my meal was so good I kept trying to bite into it while it was still hot, burning my mouth multiple times.

            "text": "I find this place absolutely delicious, but rarely end up going there when the inevitable conversation arises: \"Where do you want to go? I dunno. Where do you want to go?\" It is a bit tucked away in a little strip mall, so I'm going to chalk it up to location and not the fact that I typically have the memory of a gnat.\n\nIf you've never had a pasty (pronounced pah-stee, unlike the pay-stee nipple adhesives strippers wear), you're missing out on a hearty English Hot Pocket. However, likening it to a Hot Pocket does it a disservice. Hot Pockets consist of cardboard crust filled with nuclear hot goo that causes blisters and cursing, rather than sighs of content and delight. While both are great drunk/hangover food, the Cornish Pasty Co. far surpasses the measly freezer dried Hot Pocket. \n\nWhile they have flavors that are also available as Hot Pocket varieties (taste test!), my dining partner routinely reminds me that he will shun me for indulge in one of those. Not that it's hard to find at least five different flavors that you could imagine chowing down. I always end up just blurting out my decision at the last minute to end my indecisiveness. They updated the menu recently and it now includes a bunch of flavors that weren't previously available, like carne adovada. Mmm. So if you haven't been here in a while, give it another go and try something new.\n\nFor about seven bucks you get a huge, stick-to-your-ribs pastry filled with a wide variety of meats and vegetables. I've never tried the vegetarian choices, but there are quite a few on the menu (about half as many as the non-vegetarian options). Among the traditional pasties, you can't go wrong with the oggie, shepards pie or lamb and mint. I've tried the chicken tikka masala, greek chicken, and lamb vindaloo from the fancy schmancy options and they were just as stellar. The greek salad is also pretty respectable, with a hefty amount of kalamata olives and feta cheese. \n\nWatching the cooks at work is part of the fun at this place, so have a seat at the bar. Just make sure to do so far enough away from the oven that you won't end up dried out like beef jerky at the end of your meal. When you get the bill, there's a cashier near the door that you can cash out at if you're in a hurry, since the servers are a little bit on the slow side. Slow, laid back, whatever. \n\nTheir happy hour is also an awesome option to opt for, and is offered every day from 3 to 5 pm. There's a dollar off beers, three dollar Irish car bombs and two dollar top shelf shots (Ketel One vodka, Jameson whiskey, etc.), so if you're looking to spend an afternoon getting stinko and munching on some awesome food, this is the place to be.\n\nUPDATE: I've tried just about every non-veggie pasty on the menu. The salmon trumps them all. Do it.",

Though the pasty menu is extensive and creative with lots of veggie options too.  It was fantastic!  Succulent steak chunks and vegetables wrapped up in the delicious pastry crust. Very authentic!  Also had the mushy peas, true British chippy style. \n\nFor dessert I had to have the sticky toffee pudding as that's my all time favourite 'afters' from home. It arrived in its own black cauldron with a side of creme anglaise. Absolutely amazing! The sweet gooey toffee inside was perfectly warm and runny.

            "text": "Dating back hundreds of years, the Cornish pasty comes from humble beginnings. The half moon shaped baked pastry filled with meat and vegetables was designed as a lunch for soot-covered Cornish tin miners. To eat it, miners would hold the pasty at the crimped edge, and then discard that part after eating the rest of the pasty. This way the miners didn't eat the dirt they were covered in, missing out on ingesting stuff like arsenic that was common in the mines. While most tin mining is gone, we're fortunate to have the Cornish Pasty Co., which specializes in pasties.\n\nWith restaurants in Tempe and Mesa, each location has its own spirit. While both are laid back, the Tempe location has a more subdued feel with dim lighting and no windows. Mesa has a brighter interior with indie rock blaring over the sound system.\n\nIf you enjoy watching kitchen action, belly up to the bar at either locale for a first-hand look into the hard work that goes into making their delicious pasties.\n\nAs soon as I entered the Tempe location, the warm smell of wine gravy and fresh baked crust covered me like a blanket of mouth-watering comfort. The feeling was like going home for the holidays. I know it's a million degrees outside, but the feeling transcends the summer heat.\n\nThe first pasty I tried, The Pilgrim ($8), exemplified everything that tastes good at Thanksgiving, luscious turkey breast, sweet potatoes, stuffing and grilled onions all wrapped in a tender crust, then served with a side of cranberry sauce. After one bite, I felt like I needed to pay thanks to someone.\n\nThe Porky ($7) is filled with all that is good: pork, apples, potatoes, onions and sage and served with a side of red wine gravy. The problem with the gravy is that it's so tasty I'm not sure whether to dunk my pasty into it or drink it.\n\nNever able to resist a good burger, I decided to take a chance with the Royale with Cheese ($7.50). Ordered medium, this pasty was brimming with a juicy hamburger, French fries and cheese and served with a side of Thousand Island dressing. As the meat juices ran down my face, I couldn't help but think of the scene in Pulp Fiction where John Travolta explains to Samuel Jackson what the name of a Quarter Pounder with Cheese is in Amsterdam.\n\nThe Peanut Butter and Jelly ($5) was served piping hot. One bite of this was not going to be enough. Filled with creamy peanut butter, raspberry preserves and sliced banana, the sweet goodness oozed out after the first cut was made. The plate was expertly cleaned in mere moments.\n\nCornish Pasty Co. has a small, but great, beer selection, including one of my favorites, Kronenbourg 1664. Plus visit during their daily happy hour from 3-5pm and you'll enjoy a buck off of every pint.",

It just tastes better!\n\nCPC delivers on all counts.  It's kinda loud (but I liked the music, so that's OK :) and kinda dark, but that's OK too.  Pasties are English pies miners would take to work for their lunch.  The Missus had the Shepherds Pie pasty (she had the ground beef, but lamb is an option, as it should be) and I had the Indian curry pasty - two big hits!  The pie is crusty, golden brown and delicious outside, nice and delicate inside.  Fillings are yummy, service was great!  The House Special pasty has rutabagas in it, which I despise, and the friendly server was most apologetic that they couldn't take them out, but said if I called ahead they would be glad to remove the offending root veggies with some advance notice - nice of them to offer to accommodate my distaste for root vegetables in general (and rutabagas in particular).\n\nIn summary: great, interesting food, friendly service, reasonable priced - we'll be back and I recommend you stop by as well, and see what this whole pasty thing is all about!",

            "text": "Reasons Why I Love CPC: \nGREAT FOOD\nGREAT PRICES\nGREAT ATMOSPHERE\nNICE STAFF\nDELIVERY!!\n \nI had never tasted the glory that is a pasty until I went there by recommendation of a friend a few years ago. Ever since my first visit, I have been hooked. I have learned to order one pasty for lunch, and get another to-go for later-- because knowing me, I will have a second craving during the day.\n\n  The first time I went I courageously tried their Chicken Tikka Masala pasty. My grandfather is from India, and I was raised on traditional Indian food, so I was a skeptic. However, their take on chicken masala (typically consisting of chicken, red curry, potatoes, vegetables and accompanied with rice) was impressive. There was just the right amount of curry to chicken to vegetable ratio, and I could not help but want to scarf it down. It was mild, so anyone could love it. Even their Vegetarian Tikka Masala pasty is delicious. As a former vegetarian and vegan, I am always skeptical when trying new meat substitutes, but the Quorn chicken substitute has a great consistency. \n \nAnother time I went, I tried their Shepherd's Pie Pasty, and declared that a victory. The pastry shell was crisp, the filling was flavorful, and the peas and carrots hadn't gone to mush. You can tell that they make the pasties (pastys?) fresh just by biting into them, but if you're not convinced, sit up at the bar and watch. \n\n  I will say, one of the best pasties they have is their Lovely Bit a Salmon. It took me a while to be able to order it because every time I tried, they were sold out (AND FOR GOOD REASONING!). I got lucky one unassuming Tuesday afternoon while ordering delivery for my mother, my roommate and myself. They were surprisingly prompt in their delivery and didn't seem to get lost with my crappy directions to my apartment. I ordered the Salmon, my mother the Pilgrim (SOOOO GOOD), and my roommate the Cheese Steak ( I didn't try his, but he said it was awesome). The Salmon pasty was heaven. I am not kidding- HEAVEN wrapped in a delicate pastry blanket and hand delivered from The Almighty Himself. The salmon was cooked to perfection, the dill sauce was mild, the asparagus still al dente, the potatoes were perfect, and the tomatoes and spinach were an added plus. \n\n My new favorite \"every-now-and-again\" pasty is The Peanut Butter and Jelly. HOLY GUACAMOLE! They have taken the traditional PB&J and slapped it in the face sent it home to it's momma. Then added some refinement, and some ooey-gooey, yummy in my tummy, goody-goody gumdrops to it. Holy Toledo. The banana is welcomed added bonus.  \n \nTo be honest, I have yet to try a pasty there that I do not like. This is a great thing, yet can be very unhelpful when trying to figure out what to have for lunch or dinner. \n\n Maybe someone can help me... I do not know what is in their salad dressing for their basic green salad... but it is AMAZING! \n Their garlic roasted potatoes and mushy peas are so yummy as well. \n\n They have my two drink requirements on tap: Guinness and Boddingtons. Also, they have Duvel which is one of my favorite Belgian beers for a moderate price. They have great Happy Hour drink specials including $3 car bombs. $3! YOU CAN'T BEAT THAT!\n\n Dine in, take out, or delivery. It doesn't matter how you get it, just GET IT! Make sure that if you order their green salad you get extra dressing--you will be happy that you did.",

            "text": "It has been a LONG TIME since I have been to this place, but I would love to put my 10 cents in.  First off, before eating here I didn't even know meat pies existed.  It was like an awesome burrito but with a flaky crust and WAY more choices.  When I lived in Tempe I was a terribly picky eater and every single time I came in I got the same thing, the meatball pasty.  It was awesome, everytime.  Everything on the menu looks delicious and it looks like the flavors blend together very well.  They are premade before you get there, so you cant really have them take ingredients out, although I am sure if you let them know ahead of time it can be arranged.\n\nSo there are 2 things I would like to talk about here.  First, the atmosphere.  Walking in you have a tiny restaurant that has a bar on one side and some small tables against the wall.  All the waiters are tatted up and lend an air of ruggedness to the joint.  As you sit at the bar, they are right in front of you rolling up the pasties and behind them are the stoves that they bake your pies in after you order them.  So basically you are sitting at a bar, drinking a cold beer and you can feel the heat from the ovens.  In some places this would be annoying, but again I feel like it lends greatness to the atmosphere.  The music is usually some good British rock and once again, yes, lends to the atmosphere.  So I enjoy feeling like I am in some tiny pub in Cornwall.\n\nSecond, THE DESSERT!  I will start with the Strawberry Pavlova which I could have done without.  The meringue shell is light and unless that is your cup of tea, keep on reading.  The PB&J pasty I only had one time and it was good, but second rate for me compared to the next two items.  Next up is the caramel apple pasty.  Delish!  Apple and caramel baked into the pie shell and topped with ice cream.  However nothing in this world can touch the BANOFFEE Pie!  Dig this real quick, a thick graham cracker pie crust.  Top that with caramel.  Top that with whipped cream and top that with bananas.  Oh, and if you are crazy ask them for strawberries too...and ice cream.  Now eat that and tell me you've had a better dessert.  I sure as hell havent!",

ALL of them.  There are only a few of the veggie pasties I haven't tried.  Outside of the original and traditional ones, though, the Rosemary Chicken and the Pilgrim have to be my favorites.  There's no need for side dishes or appetizer breads or anything, since every delicious bite you need comes wrapped up neatly in an egg-brushed pastry pocket fresh out of the oven.  It's exactly the right amount of food.\n\nThe owner is an extremely friendly, knowledgeable, and cool fella, and he's always looking at ways to make his business better.  He's chosen a great crew to meet the increasing demands of this growing hot spot, since everyone who works there is nice and down-to-earth.  I've never seen a single employee lounging or wasting time there.\n\nWhat they do really, really well:  (1) All of the FOOD, including the salads and desserts.  (2) The beer selection is incredible, full of tasty imports and domestics both on tap and in bottles.  (3) The prices are excellent.  (4) The decor is sleek and modern, complete with classic rock playing at a quiet yet audible volume.\n\nWhat they could improve on:  There's very little room for parties of 4.  There's plenty of counter space, a handful of tables for 2, and a custom table for 3 that's kind of neat, but the small area at the back that used to be smaller tables is now one large table.  Parties of 4 now take up the whole area (that could seat up to 8), making it awkward for any other big parties coming in.  Plus, you can't cut through tables to sit on the bench side of the booth anymore.  You have to scoot down the length of the table and then push everyone out again if you have to get up for any reason.  (A very small fault, considering that everything else about the place is incredible!)\n\nOverall, this is one of Tempe's best little restaurants.  Whenever I'm not craving food from a particular location, pasties have become the default food for my whole household.  They're always tasty and we just never get tired of them.  I have to move out of state soon, and of all the places we've eaten in our 10 years here, I will miss the Cornish Pasty Company the most!!!",

I think we made the rookie mistake of entering through the dark, candle-lit kitchen side (with tables along the wall) rather than the far door with the actual dining room, but sitting on either is fine. They even have a patio!\n\nThe staff was great, answering any questions we had about the menu and service was well-paced. Now...the FOOD! As a (mostly) vegetarian, I was pretty blown away by the options - I have to eat a lot of veggie burgers elsewhere - but this place has a whole vegan/vegetarian page of items, some of which include veggie chicken and beef. Forget what anyone else has said...nothing could be better than the Eggplant Parmesan pastie! ;) My sister also loved her Lamb and Mint pastie, saying it was \"effing delicious\" and that the mint was not overpowering. The pastry is not doughy like pizza crust, but rather flaky and crispy like a biscuit. The vegetables were cooked perfectly, as they were fresh and still a little crunchy. \n\nLiterally my only complaint about this place is that my meal was so good I kept trying to bite into it while it was still hot, burning my mouth multiple times. I look forward to coming back the next time I'm visiting my sis in Tempe, as I know she's about to jump on the Cornish Pastry Co regular train! She already has the \"Pilgrim\" pastie picked out as her next one to try and at about $9/meal, I bet she'll have worked through most of the menu by the time I see her again.\n\nDefinitely put this on your \"must see\" list of places to eat (for lunch)!",

            "text": "Let me first start off by saying that I love Cornish Pasty. So why the three star review? Well, their food is great, but the service is lousy. But let me back up a bit.\n\nThe very first time someone told me about \"The Pasty,\" as I refer to it, they described a pasty as \"a gourmet hot pocket.\" Let me tell you, that did not sound appealing. Despite how great they tried to make it sound, I could not get over the idea of a gourmet hot pocket. So I never checked it out until maybe a year ago when I was recommended by another friend, and figured I'd just give it a shot. It was delightful!\n\nI've since been to The Pasty multiple times. It's the food that keeps me coming back. \"The Pilgrim\" is like Thanksgiving! I get it almost every time. It's a combination of turkey, sweet potatoes, onions, mushrooms, and other wonderful flavors inside. Served with a side of cranberry sauce and a red wine gravy. I'm not too crazy about the gravy, but the cranberry sauce is awesome. I've also tried their Greek salad and black bean soup, which are just as wonderful. I love the bread that comes with the soup, and the dressing on the salad.\n\nAlthough this location is closer to my house, I prefer going to the one on Guadalupe and Dobson because the service is slightly better (although both locations have poor service). And this location on University is way too dark and full of hipsters. But, I guess people dig that nowadays.\n\nThe main reason I'm writing this review is because of a trip I made to this location yesterday. I went with my boyfriend and we split all three items mentioned above. The Greek salad, black bean soup, and The Pilgrim. I was starving and was hoping our server would bring the soup and salad out first. I was thrilled when she came back after a couple minutes with the soup and was hoping the salad would come out shortly after. I love bread and when we ran out of bread (meaning after I scarfed all the bread down), I patiently waited for our server to come back around so I could ask for more bread, as well as the status on our salad. Remember when I said I was starving? Well, I start to get a little cranky when I'm hungry, and our server was not making any rounds to see how her tables were doing. After fifteen or so minutes, I decide to go over to where our server is talking with another server, and ask for more bread, nicely of course. Once she comes back with our bread, the soup is cold, but I don't really mind. I was just happy she put more bread in front of me. A few minutes later our pasty comes out. She had obviously forgotten about our salad (guess that's what happens when you don't write anything down) so I reminded her and she comes back shortly with it. Only after we had been sitting there for ten minutes after we had finished everything and the busser, who was much friendly than our server, had already cleared the table, did our server appear from the darkness and we were finally able to get our check, pay, and leave. I'm used to the service being not so great, but this was just awful.\n\nI thought maybe if I wrote a review about my last experience, they'd change the service up or hire better servers. Serving itself isn't very hard, I know, I've done it. And it doesn't take much effort to check up on a table. But the people who work at The Pasty just don't seem to care about anything. I guess that's just a hipster thing. (I would love to see their interview process, if there even is one. \"Do you know how to carry food?\" \"Yes.\" \"Okay, you're hired.\")\n\nAnyway, I think I will be driving out of the way to go to the other Pasty instead. Since their servers are a little more attentive and I can actually see who I'm eating with, and what I'm eating for that matter. Hah, I can only imagine what that place looks like in the light. Maybe they keep it dark for a reason.\n\nIt's not like I'm expecting five star service or anything, I get that it's a bar too. But come on. If you're the type that doesn't like their server to stop by a lot, or you don't need any refills, then this place would be perfect for you.",

            "text": "It has been a LONG TIME since I have been to this place, but I would love to put my 10 cents in.  First off, before eating here I didn't even know meat pies existed.  It was like an awesome burrito but with a flaky crust and WAY more choices.  When I lived in Tempe I was a terribly picky eater and every single time I came in I got the same thing, the meatball pasty.  It was awesome, everytime.  Everything on the menu looks delicious and it looks like the flavors blend together very well.  They are premade before you get there, so you cant really have them take ingredients out, although I am sure if you let them know ahead of time it can be arranged.\n\nSo there are 2 things I would like to talk about here.  First, the atmosphere.  Walking in you have a tiny restaurant that has a bar on one side and some small tables against the wall.  All the waiters are tatted up and lend an air of ruggedness to the joint.  As you sit at the bar, they are right in front of you rolling up the pasties and behind them are the stoves that they bake your pies in after you order them.  So basically you are sitting at a bar, drinking a cold beer and you can feel the heat from the ovens.  In some places this would be annoying, but again I feel like it lends greatness to the atmosphere.  The music is usually some good British rock and once again, yes, lends to the atmosphere.  So I enjoy feeling like I am in some tiny pub in Cornwall.\n\nSecond, THE DESSERT!  I will start with the Strawberry Pavlova which I could have done without.  The meringue shell is light and unless that is your cup of tea, keep on reading.  The PB&J pasty I only had one time and it was good, but second rate for me compared to the next two items.  Next up is the caramel apple pasty.  Delish!  Apple and caramel baked into the pie shell and topped with ice cream.  However nothing in this world can touch the BANOFFEE Pie!  Dig this real quick, a thick graham cracker pie crust.  Top that with caramel.  Top that with whipped cream and top that with bananas.  Oh, and if you are crazy ask them for strawberries too...and ice cream.  Now eat that and tell me you've had a better dessert.  I sure as hell havent!",

From the traditional Oggie with beef, onions, potatoes and rutabaga with a lovely red wine gravy, to the adventurous Lamb Vindaloo with basmati rice, potatoes, lamb and a wonderfully spicy vindaloo sauce all of Dean's creations are worth trying.\n\nWe have been visiting this hidden wonder for a couple of years now and have tried most of the items on the menu. (Except for the vegetarian pasties which we just have not gotten to yet.) It is nearly impossible for me to pick a favorite, they are all that good!\n\nIf you enjoy beer then Dean's selections will please you. Not a drab, tasteless lager in the bunch! Hoegaarden on draught as well as Guiness, Harp and Strongbow Cider plus a few others to keep a beer lover happy for a long time.\n\nThe current location is quite small however and it's proximity to ASU guarantees a packed house on Friday and Saturday nights. Happily, Dean is opening a second location in Mesa on Doson Rd. and Guadalupe Rd. that will not only be larger but has a more open environment as well. Opening has been announced for Saturday, January 17th 2009 and you can bet we'll be there.\n\nTake the time to find The Cornish Pasty Co. you will come back again and again!",

My grandparents bought them at the grocery store premade - all we had to do was warm them up in the oven. When Cornish Pasty Co. announced they were going to open in Tempe back in 2005, I was ecstatic and for good reasons - it was love at first bite. \n\nSince 2005, I've tried many different pasties and still can't decide which my favorite is. The Oggie is a good standard- it's what my memory from Michigan tastes like only better. The Pilgrim is amazing - but only when made with Turkey. Honestly, my favorite part is the crust that holds the goodies. I don't care what is inside, as long as that crust is flakey and warm. Mmm... One time I ordered a small Greek Salad and now I have to order it every time I'm there. The dressing they use is this lemony pesto and it is so, so good... the only down side is that I'm still tasting it hours later. It's that strong! To finish up, you have got to order the chocolate bread pudding with crème angelias AND ice cream. The bread is deliciously chocolately but it is also soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside, which I love. The husband isn't too crazy about it (\"bread pudding shouldn't be crunchy!\"), but that means more for me!\n\nThey have happy hour starting at 3pm, which includes drink specials. I've only ordered a Gin and Tonic here and as far as I'm concerned, it's pretty damn good. One time they were out of tonic and they made a special trip to go out and buy some, just so I could have my drink. I felt pretty special that night.\n\nWe have been to the location in Mesa and the patio is really nice, but the original restaurant has rustic charm. Whether you are sitting at the bar top or in a corner booth, you can feel the energy of the restaurant and be intimate with your dining partner. It's nice they expanded the restaurant and were still able to keep the same ambiance. \n\nAnytime we are in Tempe, this is always one of our stops and a place we frequently take friends. If you are ever in the area, definitely stop in!!",

Their british pub concept could be so cool, but instead it was really dark (blackout curtains on every window), way too loud (blaring music), and just overall way too hipster grunge for me (hello, Seattle). Dining experience aside, the menu is giant and the food is really good. I had:\n-  Greek Pasty: Vegetarian and I absolutely loved all the flavors in it. It was full of cheese, artichoke hearts, sun dried tomatoes, and olives all wrapped up in a warm buttery crust. \n- House Salad: Really fresh (amazing tomatoes) and good-sized. \n- Sticky Toffee Pudding: Having read about the dessert in English books, I've always wanted to try it. It was pretty good but probably not something I'd order again. After this dish and watching enough Downtown Abbey, I finally get that the English call their cakes \"pudding\". So it's not pudding at all, but a cake. There really wasn't enough of a toffee flavor, and instead most of the cake had a mild molasses flavor. Parts of the cake were really dry, so the vanilla ice cream its served with made it a lot better. This is certainly a fun dessert to try, but not totally my favorite.\n\nI only ate half of my pasty at dinner, then ate the other half a few hours later in the comfort of my own home, and definitely enjoyed the leftover half in my home a whole lot more. So overall, I really recommend the food, just in a to-go form :)",

I ordered the Pesto Chicken (decent) and he got the Lovely Bit a Salmon (much better). In subsequent visits I would discover the Royale with Cheese which is my favorite pasty so far. Also, the Mexican and the Carne Adovada are fantastic menu options. \n\nOutside of the pasty realm, almost everything else on the menu is worth trying. The Greek Salad has to be my favorite of the salad choices; the dressing really makes this dish. Comprised of homemade caramel sauce, bananas, thick graham cracker crust, and whipped cream--the Banoffee Pie is to die for. \n\nAnd now for drinks...they offer a pretty good beer selection. And Car Bombs are always $3.00 (yes, please!). The happy hour is alright, but Wednesday Wino Day is the best drink special ($3). \n\nWe can't wait to try the PB&J pasty for dessert next time we go back!",

To begin, the place itself is really dark (kind of divey) which I'm not a huge fan of. Others would probably like it, but at 1pm, I want there to be a little bit of light in a building so I can see what I'm eating, others at the table, etc. \n\nThe pasty was \"ok\" in my opinion. The pastry itself is flaky and was pretty good. It seemed though that the filling varied at the table --depending on what you order, you may get something dry. I ended up getting a pasty that was supposed to be filled with spicy chicken and green chile but the chicken wasn't that spicy. The chile was just \"ok\" considering that we're in the southwest. \n\nDrinks seemed expensive (and I'm talking about sodas here) and they charge for refills? I ended up getting a water. \n\nOverall, I wasn't as impressed as others clearly are. Maybe we came at a bad day/time for the pasty.

I've had a hankering for a pasty for quite some time and thought I'd have to wait until my next trip to the upper Midwest. \n\nFor starters, I like the menu here. Places that do one thing and do it well rate highly with me, and this place does pasties. There are about a dozen different kinds of pasties on the menu ranging from traditional (beef & potatoes or chicken pot pie) to unusual (salmon or Mexican), for example. The pasties are pre-made and warmed up to order and come with sauces. The red wine gravy I tried was very good. There are a few side dishes like chips, slaw, and beans, and some good looking desserts. (I can't say how they tasted; I had a second Strongbow for dessert.) They have several beers on draft and some bottles, too. \n\nI thought the portion size was decent, but certainly not huge, and the prices fair, especially considering the next nearest pasty place is probably hundreds or thousands of miles away (aside from the CPC's other location, obviously). The pasty seemed authentic and pretty consistent with what I grew up with, but it was a bit salty and a bit dry, though the gravy helped. The flavors were good, though, and I enjoyed my Oggie (their main beef pasty). \n\nThe place is small, dark, and divey. There's a single row of tables mostly two-tops along one wall and about a dozen seats at the bar. Dark clothes, visible body piercings, and tattoos seem to be a prerequisite for employment at this place. I got the sense that this place turned into a heavy-metal bar in the evenings, though I could be wrong. I certainly enjoyed the Queen playing when I got there, and the two guys that waited on me at the bar were friendly, cool guys, and the service was efficient. \n\nThis is a place I'll visit whenever I'm in town. There's just nothing like it outside of England and the upper Midwest.",

It was not in the most obvious location and when the group I was with went to walk in the front door we almost didn't know we were in the right place.

They have a nice collection on tap and even more beers, I believe, in the bottle. I like that you can watch the food prep opera at the bar as they are continually putting together new pasties to keep up the supplies or, one of my new favorites, when the weather is nice, sit at the outside patio to enjoy the cool weather and the piped out music, which is audible but not overpowering.\n\nMy favorite pasties, which are a welsh savory pastry, are:\n\nThe Peppered Steak\nThe Greek (vegetarian)\n\nI'm also a big fan of their incredibly fresh house salads with pesto dressing - a regular is good enough for two people or half works for a single serving. I understand there are now locations in Mesa and Old Town Scottsdale but this was the original location and dare I say it, still my favorite. Worth checking out if you are looking for a place with good food and good beer, and people watching is always fun due to the location close to the University, it has a significant bohemian vibe and though I'm not a hipster (too old and too fat), it is fun to mingle with the more visible members of the creative class that Richard Florida writes about.",

Their tzatziki sauce is out of this world--and I don't usually like yogurt-based sauces. In fact, I can't think of a yogurt sauce I do like! Other tzatzikis fall flat in comparison.

We both tried the \"original\" pasty which we both agreed it was true to the original. It was hot, and full of the expected ingredients. In addition to the original the have many other types of pasty's, from Greek, to Mexican, vegetarian, chicken, salmon, to name a few. We would have liked to try some other styles of pasty, and will do so on our next visit to the Tempe area.  In addition to the pasty I did try a cup of one of the soups. The Cream of Leek, Potato and Stilton soup was to die for. A bowl of this soup could have been a meal in itself. Beer choices were very good, and they do have a happy hour 3-6 and all day Sunday with $1 off all beers.",

            "text": "The first time I ever had a pasty was in Michigan when I was 10 years old. My grandparents bought them at the grocery store premade - all we had to do was warm them up in the oven. When Cornish Pasty Co. announced they were going to open in Tempe back in 2005, I was ecstatic and for good reasons - it was love at first bite. \n\nSince 2005, I've tried many different pasties and still can't decide which my favorite is. The Oggie is a good standard- it's what my memory from Michigan tastes like only better. The Pilgrim is amazing - but only when made with Turkey. Honestly, my favorite part is the crust that holds the goodies. I don't care what is inside, as long as that crust is flakey and warm. Mmm... One time I ordered a small Greek Salad and now I have to order it every time I'm there. The dressing they use is this lemony pesto and it is so, so good... the only down side is that I'm still tasting it hours later. It's that strong! To finish up, you have got to order the chocolate bread pudding with crème angelias AND ice cream. The bread is deliciously chocolately but it is also soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside, which I love. The husband isn't too crazy about it (\"bread pudding shouldn't be crunchy!\"), but that means more for me!\n\nThey have happy hour starting at 3pm, which includes drink specials. I've only ordered a Gin and Tonic here and as far as I'm concerned, it's pretty damn good. One time they were out of tonic and they made a special trip to go out and buy some, just so I could have my drink. I felt pretty special that night.\n\nWe have been to the location in Mesa and the patio is really nice, but the original restaurant has rustic charm. Whether you are sitting at the bar top or in a corner booth, you can feel the energy of the restaurant and be intimate with your dining partner. It's nice they expanded the restaurant and were still able to keep the same ambiance. \n\nAnytime we are in Tempe, this is always one of our stops and a place we frequently take friends. If you are ever in the area, definitely stop in!!",

If you don't know what that is then think about as...[moan]...a Hot Pocket.\n\nAs far as the pasties go, the Lamb Vindaloo is my favorite. I've also tried The Chicken Greek (least favorite), Chicken Tikka Masala, Lovely Bit a Salmon, and the Peppered Steak. They also have a good selection of vegetarian pasties even though I have yet to try them.\n\nThis place has expanded and added a lot more space on the other side, but, in my opinion, lost a bit of charm. Something about being uncomfortably hot near the ovens on a summer day in a somewhat cramped setting equals pure character, and I do miss it. Unless I'm hungry.\n\nThe staff is laid-back and pretty cool reminding me of dives in Austin, Charlotte, and Philly.\n\nIf you want, you can get the pasties half-baked so you can take them home and pop them in a 425-degree oven for 15-20 minutes. But why deprive yourself the experience of enjoying it here?",

They have a nice collection on tap and even more beers, I believe, in the bottle. I like that you can watch the food prep opera at the bar as they are continually putting together new pasties to keep up the supplies or, one of my new favorites, when the weather is nice, sit at the outside patio to enjoy the cool weather and the piped out music, which is audible but not overpowering.\n\nMy favorite pasties, which are a welsh savory pastry, are:\n\nThe Peppered Steak\nThe Greek (vegetarian)\n\nI'm also a big fan of their incredibly fresh house salads with pesto dressing - a regular is good enough for two people or half works for a single serving. I understand there are now locations in Mesa and Old Town Scottsdale but this was the original location and dare I say it, still my favorite. Worth checking out if you are looking for a place with good food and good beer, and people watching is always fun due to the location close to the University, it has a significant bohemian vibe and though I'm not a hipster (too old and too fat), it is fun to mingle with the more visible members of the creative class that Richard Florida writes about.",

We had checked out the website and menu, so knew what we wanted to try.  \nFirst thing, in a lot of pictures, the place looks really cramped and small...wrong!   When you first walk in, there's a narrow hallway with a bar on one side and small 2-seat tables on the other.  But, if you walk around the corner, it opens up into a pretty large dining room (there's also a bar in here), as well as a nice sized patio.\nWe seated ourselves, and were immediately met by Hannah, our server.  She was friendly and made us feel welcome.  We perused the menu, but we both pretty much knew what we wanted.  \nI ordered \"The Pilgrim\" and my hubby ordered \"The Reuben\".  While we waited for our pasty's, we were able to enjoy the music playing.  Lots of our favorites, so the wait didn't seem like too long.  \n\"The Reuben\" is basically exactly what it sounds like...a reuben sandwich in a flaky wrap.  It was served with a side of 1000 island dressing.  My husband loved it, before I had a chance to ask for a bite...it was gone!!\n\"The Pilgrim\" is like a Thanksgiving dinner in a pasty.  It had roast chicken (during the holidays they serve it with roast turkey, but honestly, I couldn't tell the difference), sweet potatoes, stuffing and grilled onions.  It was served with a side of cranberry sauce.  OMG!!!  It was delicious and moist.  The chicken was so juicy.   Each bite reminded me of the day after Thanksgiving sandwiches...only this wasn't leftovers.  I devoured it!  My husband, who doesn't like stuffing, kept saying that when we go back, he's gonna order it.  Delicious!!!\nThe flakiness and flavor of the dough is wonderful.  Honestly, it's so moist and flavorful, you don't even need a sauce or condiment.  Most of the meals come with a red wine gravy on the side (and so did mine), but it definitely wasn't needed.  If I had ordered something with beef, it might have been a nice sauce to dunk a bite into, but like I said, it may not even be needed.\nWe're definitely going to make our way back to Tempe for another taste of a pasty, and there are a lot of very interesting ones on the menu.  We can't wait to try more!",

Luckily, it's near the Airport, so it makes a great place to have your first and/or last meal on a trip to Phoenix.\n\nPasties are tasty meat or vegetable pies meant to be lowered to hungry miners in Cornwall. Fortunately for us, someone thought of  bringing them to the US, and particularly to the Phoenix area. I had the Lamb Vindaloo (probably not an import from Cornwall), and my brother had the Balsamic Portabello. Both were delicious; the Vindaloo was spicy, but not too spicy. Go ahead and order it - you won't be sorry.  Since this was sort of dinner, we then shared the Pilgrim, which incorporated turkey, sweet potatoes, stuffing and a side of cranberry sauce. This was OK, but could have used more turkey, and less stuffing. Pies ranged from $6.50-9.00.\n\nExcellent selection of European draft beers in 14, 20, and 34 ounce mugs, the largest being a mere $8-9 bucks. Also many imported premium bottles, plus Tempe's own Four Peaks Kilt Lifter (6%) for only $3.50. What a deal.\n\nFor other New Yorkers reading this, I understand Myers of Keswick, a shop on Hudson Street, has Cornish Pasties and other meat pies. They're generally less than $4.00, so probably smaller and for takeout only. I'll give you an update on this next time I'm down in the Village.",

I have never been into a darker cave in my life to eat food. Second, only one local craft brew on tap was disappointing. I love sampling the local beers when I travel, so I would have loved a choice of three or four. \n\nI'd totally come back here, even just for takeout. ASU students - I hope you know how good you got it. \n\nCheers, mate.",

If you've never been, they'll almost certainly have something you like. My only problem is that nothing is customizable: they're all served as is, which I understand from a production standpoint, but which frustrates for the number of menu items with just one dealbreaking ingredient for me.\n\nOverall, it's exceedingly easy to be a regular, and to feel VERY full, careful not to eat the crimped part of the pasty, just like the tin miners of yore so as to avoid the traces of arsenic from their dirty hands.",

We had checked out the website and menu, so knew what we wanted to try.  \nFirst thing, in a lot of pictures, the place looks really cramped and small...wrong!   When you first walk in, there's a narrow hallway with a bar on one side and small 2-seat tables on the other.  But, if you walk around the corner, it opens up into a pretty large dining room (there's also a bar in here), as well as a nice sized patio.\nWe seated ourselves, and were immediately met by Hannah, our server.  She was friendly and made us feel welcome.  We perused the menu, but we both pretty much knew what we wanted.  \nI ordered \"The Pilgrim\" and my hubby ordered \"The Reuben\".  While we waited for our pasty's, we were able to enjoy the music playing.  Lots of our favorites, so the wait didn't seem like too long.  \n\"The Reuben\" is basically exactly what it sounds like...a reuben sandwich in a flaky wrap.  It was served with a side of 1000 island dressing.  My husband loved it, before I had a chance to ask for a bite...it was gone!!\n\"The Pilgrim\" is like a Thanksgiving dinner in a pasty.  It had roast chicken (during the holidays they serve it with roast turkey, but honestly, I couldn't tell the difference), sweet potatoes, stuffing and grilled onions.  It was served with a side of cranberry sauce.  OMG!!!  It was delicious and moist.  The chicken was so juicy.   Each bite reminded me of the day after Thanksgiving sandwiches...only this wasn't leftovers.  I devoured it!  My husband, who doesn't like stuffing, kept saying that when we go back, he's gonna order it.  Delicious!!!\nThe flakiness and flavor of the dough is wonderful.  Honestly, it's so moist and flavorful, you don't even need a sauce or condiment.  Most of the meals come with a red wine gravy on the side (and so did mine), but it definitely wasn't needed.  If I had ordered something with beef, it might have been a nice sauce to dunk a bite into, but like I said, it may not even be needed.\nWe're definitely going to make our way back to Tempe for another taste of a pasty, and there are a lot of very interesting ones on the menu.  We can't wait to try more!",

It's like the English version of an empanada, or like a gourmet hot pocket, haha! (ok, it really doesn't compare to a hot pocket, I'm sorry, I'm just trying to think of a good word picture!)\n\nSo, they have a million different filling options...it seems what is available on the menu might vary depending on what is fresh (LOVE food made to order that's FRESH!) The best part about this place is that they have VEGAN OPTIONS! woo hoo!!! I'm adding this place to my dairy-safe zone! \n\nI had the vegan philly cheese steak pasty, it was very good! They really do make it fresh, mine was piping hot....for the \"steak\" they used mushrooms, and whatever kind of sauce they used for the \"cheese\" was quite savory. When you order your pasty, they give you some different sauce-on-the-side options (apparently you eat pasty with sauce?) Anyways, the marinara was really good and really complemented my pasty. (a beer would have worked really well with it too.... oh well, next time!)\n\nMy husband had the oggie and thoroughly enjoyed it was well. These things are big, by the way! If you have trouble filling up, you'll be really happy with this place! And if you don't, you'll have two meals for the day for only around 10 bucks! Not bad, right?!\n\nCan't wait to come back here! Btw, this location is designed to look like inside a mine (read the menu for the background story on pasties) If you are claustrophobic, just sit towards the back, there is a nice big window back there. Otherwise, it is a bit dark and narrow in there, but still comfortable.",

Great place to gather up with the crew and down a few pints and then chow down on some tasty grub.\n\nTheir west side entrance has a long sit down bar with a few small tables and is rather cramped. The east side entrance has more of a full seating area with additional bar seating. Recommend using the east side one unless you are going undercover and need a quick escape.\n\nStarted with a cup of Cream of Leek, Potato & Stilton soup. It came with bread and butter and was very good. Ordered the Peppered Steak Pasty which is filled with Sirloin Steak, sautéed Portobello Mushrooms, Leeks, roasted Zucchini, and Stilton Bleu Cheese. It also came with a side of yummy Peppercorn Brandy Cream sauce.\n\nEverything was very satisfying. There are so many different versions of what they can make. Lamb, Chicken, Pork, Beef, and Veggie are just some of the fillings. I suppose you could make a check list and try them all. Hmmm?\n\nDon't forget some Dessert if you still have room.

Kronenbourg, Boddington's and Strongbow on tap, plus your expected hipster brews available by the bottle: Chimay and Rogue among them. The setting looks diner-ish with its long narrow strip mall set-up and open kitchen.  The atmosphere here is dark and weathered, but not dumpy.  \n\nThe difficulty here is deciding on a pasty.

Behind the bar is where the employees are cramped between the ovens and the cooking area/bar making stuff up for the customers and tripping over one another trying to maneuver around in that tiny space.  Now...don't be distressed.  It was actually a good experience.\n\nI stopped in after work by myself, pulled up a seat at the bar.  A nice young lady from behind the bar came up to take my order.  I had never been here before, so had some questions.  Also, not being a huge onion fan (at least if they are really strong) I asked about the Porky, which aside from onion in the ingredient list, looked quite good.  She assured me the taste was mild and I would not notice.  I took her at her word and she was correct.  I did not notice and enjoyed my porky.  I got it along with a hard cider and garlic roasted \"chips\" (fries).  \n\nAll in all...I was impressed by the good service, very knowledgeable staff, and in general, good food.  I think I might enjoy some of the other pasties(sp?) a bit more...but the Porky was good and quite flavorful.  The fries...the garlic they baked them with didn't really stick...so it was hit and miss...but overall...still good.  My only complaint really was by the time I got a beer, meal, and fries, it was nearly $20.  $7+ for the entree, $5 for the cider, and ~$3 for the fries.  Somewhat pricey.  But otherwise, good.  Top-notch service.",

With an incredible beer selection, nice and friendly wait staff, and incredible food, the Pasty is one of my favorite places in Tempe, hands down. \n\nTo start, get yourself one of the many awesome beers they have on tap. If you're planning on staying a while to enjoy the brand new patio (with heaters and misters), I would recommend getting an extra large glass. 32 ounces of fun. \n\nNext, go ahead and get yourself a cup of one of their awesome soups. Personal favorite: Red Pepper. Spicy, fresh, and delicious. If soup isn't your thing, I would recommend the oven chips -- oven-cooked french fries with cracked pepper. Definitely add the jalapeno. \n\nFor the main course, obviously a pasty is the way to go. My favorites include The Mexican (spiced steak strips, eggs, potatoes, jalapenos), The Royale with Cheese (hamburger, french fries, grilled onions, bacon, cheddar/swiss blend), and the Chicken Pot Pie (chicken, carrots, red potato, green beans, celery). \n\nFinish your meal off with a class Cornish Pasty desert: The Banoffee Pie. Graham cracker crust, homemade caramel with bananas, and whipped cream... If you're not melting already you should get to a past shoppe ASAP. \n\n5/5 for incredible atmosphere, food, staff, and overall experience. HIGHLY recommend.",

            "text": "Who doesn't like pastries??? And savory pastries, much less. An 'Oggie', is the classic pasty that is still savored in Cornwall and all over the UK today. After hearing so many locals rave about the famous pastry, I had to pay the Cornish Pastry Company a visit. Talk about a British pub. This place mimics the dark, mysterious alley pubs in England. The restaurant is dim, moody and spacious with pool tables, a huge bar area and a misted patio. The vibe was very mellow on a weekday afternoon, but I can imagine it gets fairly busy on the weekends. After studying the extensive list of pastries (over two dozen), I went with the Carne Adovada from the premium list and the Cajun Chicken from the signature list and a side of the the broccoli cauliflower bake.\n\nThe broccoli cauliflower bake was delivered first. Think: healthy take on mac and cheese without giving up any of the flavor. The broccoli cauliflower dish was swimming in this wonderful cheese sauce and baked with tons of cheese on top creating a perfectly crisp exterior. Definitely delicious and a must order. \n\nThe pastries came next. Similar to a calzone but a lot less doughy, and a lot more flakey; the dough recipe is perfect because it is not overpowering to the savory delicious fillings. The Adovada was filled with simmered pork in New Mexican red chili stew, Mexican rice, hatch chilies and cheddar with a side of sour cream and salsa (the sides are switched in the photos). The pork was so tender and flavorful and the stew and chilies added a perfect kick. This was a British take on a Mexican influenced dish and it was a winner. The Cajun Chicken was filled with spicy cajun chicken breast, bacon, ham and Swiss and served with a side of chipotle sauce. The chicken was tender and the bacon added the right amount of smokiness paired with the chipotle sauce. I enjoyed this pastry as well, but the Adovada was the winner.\n\nWith so many options to choose from, you really can't go wrong here. I spend about fifteen minutes on the menu trying to decide which pasty to choose. There is something for everyone here with flavors ranging form Spanish influence, to Indian influence, to Mediterranean influence. The service was on point as well. We were directed to the main seating area by the host and the waitress took time to point out some of her favorites on the menu. She didn't seem to be very knowledgable on what each pasty included and the sauces were switched on my pastries, but all was forgiven after the first bite. There is a large private parking lot for the restaurant with free parking available. I'll be back next time I'm in town.",

ALL of them.  There are only a few of the veggie pasties I haven't tried.  Outside of the original and traditional ones, though, the Rosemary Chicken and the Pilgrim have to be my favorites.  There's no need for side dishes or appetizer breads or anything, since every delicious bite you need comes wrapped up neatly in an egg-brushed pastry pocket fresh out of the oven.  It's exactly the right amount of food.\n\nThe owner is an extremely friendly, knowledgeable, and cool fella, and he's always looking at ways to make his business better.  He's chosen a great crew to meet the increasing demands of this growing hot spot, since everyone who works there is nice and down-to-earth.  I've never seen a single employee lounging or wasting time there.\n\nWhat they do really, really well:  (1) All of the FOOD, including the salads and desserts.  (2) The beer selection is incredible, full of tasty imports and domestics both on tap and in bottles.  (3) The prices are excellent.  (4) The decor is sleek and modern, complete with classic rock playing at a quiet yet audible volume.\n\nWhat they could improve on:  There's very little room for parties of 4.  There's plenty of counter space, a handful of tables for 2, and a custom table for 3 that's kind of neat, but the small area at the back that used to be smaller tables is now one large table.  Parties of 4 now take up the whole area (that could seat up to 8), making it awkward for any other big parties coming in.  Plus, you can't cut through tables to sit on the bench side of the booth anymore.  You have to scoot down the length of the table and then push everyone out again if you have to get up for any reason.  (A very small fault, considering that everything else about the place is incredible!)\n\nOverall, this is one of Tempe's best little restaurants.  Whenever I'm not craving food from a particular location, pasties have become the default food for my whole household.  They're always tasty and we just never get tired of them.  I have to move out of state soon, and of all the places we've eaten in our 10 years here, I will miss the Cornish Pasty Company the most!!!",

I was glad to see that the restaurant is doing well and remodeled their two locations with more locations coming soon. \n\nThe food at Cornish Pasty is impeccable. I always bring friends and family visiting here to try the unique cuisine. I like to explain it as 'gourmet hot pockets'. I haven't ordered a thing I didn't like. I know it can be hard for picky eaters since there are no substitutions but thankfully I don't have that problem. Their soups are amazing, all made in house. The peppered steak and chicken and rice soup are my two favorite dishes. The Mesa location recently added some new appetizers and I can't wait to try them all. Very disappointed to find that Tempe didn't add them to the menu yet. \n\nThe atmosphere, music, and excellent drink selection is another aspect I love about this place. It's good for dates as well. $5 mid shelf and always $3 Irish Car bombs with lots of microbrews on draft? YES PLEASE. \n\nThe one thing I hate about Cornish Pasty, and the reason why I give it 2/5 is the SERVICE SUCKS. It must be a requirement to be a hipster with 5+ visible tattoos/piercings with a poor work effort. You even get a raise for having poor personal hygiene! I've been eating at Cornish Pasty for 5 years and have never received good service. Last time I ate at the mesa location the service had improved a lot, unfortunately I went to Tempe a week later and had awful service. I could go into detail about the awful service, forgetting ordered items, being ignored and the general distasteful appearance of the staff. I don't mind tattoos and piercings, I have some! I was even a waitress for 7 years, but you should really brush your hair, shower, or wear socks to work.\n\nIf you like great food, drinks and atmosphere and can stand the idiots they hire to serve you. Then definitely eat here. I will continue to be a regular, I just wish their management would shape up those servers. I would recommend the Mesa location over the Tempe one. The Mesa one added new menu items, I ate there about 3 weeks ago and received great service. The Tempe one continues to disappoint. Although the food is always top notch.",

I think we made the rookie mistake of entering through the dark, candle-lit kitchen side (with tables along the wall) rather than the far door with the actual dining room, but sitting on either is fine. They even have a patio!\n\nThe staff was great, answering any questions we had about the menu and service was well-paced. Now...the FOOD! As a (mostly) vegetarian, I was pretty blown away by the options - I have to eat a lot of veggie burgers elsewhere - but this place has a whole vegan/vegetarian page of items, some of which include veggie chicken and beef. Forget what anyone else has said...nothing could be better than the Eggplant Parmesan pastie! ;) My sister also loved her Lamb and Mint pastie, saying it was \"effing delicious\" and that the mint was not overpowering. The pastry is not doughy like pizza crust, but rather flaky and crispy like a biscuit. The vegetables were cooked perfectly, as they were fresh and still a little crunchy. \n\nLiterally my only complaint about this place is that my meal was so good I kept trying to bite into it while it was still hot, burning my mouth multiple times. I look forward to coming back the next time I'm visiting my sis in Tempe, as I know she's about to jump on the Cornish Pastry Co regular train! She already has the \"Pilgrim\" pastie picked out as her next one to try and at about $9/meal, I bet she'll have worked through most of the menu by the time I see her again.\n\nDefinitely put this on your \"must see\" list of places to eat (for lunch)!",

If you're planning on staying a while to enjoy the brand new patio (with heaters and misters), I would recommend getting an extra large glass. 32 ounces of fun. \n\nNext, go ahead and get yourself a cup of one of their awesome soups. Personal favorite: Red Pepper. Spicy, fresh, and delicious. If soup isn't your thing, I would recommend the oven chips -- oven-cooked french fries with cracked pepper. Definitely add the jalapeno. \n\nFor the main course, obviously a pasty is the way to go. My favorites include The Mexican (spiced steak strips, eggs, potatoes, jalapenos), The Royale with Cheese (hamburger, french fries, grilled onions, bacon, cheddar/swiss blend), and the Chicken Pot Pie (chicken, carrots, red potato, green beans, celery). \n\nFinish your meal off with a class Cornish Pasty desert: The Banoffee Pie. Graham cracker crust, homemade caramel with bananas, and whipped cream...

All though the fillings are great, my favorite part of the pasty is the soft, doughy, yet flaky outside. They seem to bake each one to the perfect golden brown! One pasty is pretty large, so depending on how hungry I am, I sometimes finish the whole thing but most times have some leftover.\n\nThey have a pretty extensive menu and the choices are so unique there's literally something for everyone. If you're vegetarian then you'll definitely be in luck because they have a whole list of vegetarian and vegan options too!\n\nUnfortunately, the only dessert I've tried at Cornish Pasty has been the Shirley Temple's Pudding.

I definitely recommend saving room to get something.\n\nOverall, the service is also good but it's a popular spot so they get pretty busy.

Some other recommendations are the Shepard's Pie or Chicken Pot Pie. They even have vegetarian pasties. One important fact- you can't modify the ingredients. They come as they are and they are delicious!!",

I have eaten every Pasty on the menu, and I honestly don't think i have been disappointed once (maybe a thing or two forgotten when we do take out but they always make up for it) \n\nIt is a super original spot to take your family if you are in town. There is a nice dining room with a bar and an outdoor patio on the north side, and then on the south end there is a whole other local bar spot called \"The Beast\". A lot of people don't even know it's there. Its a super hip dark lit bar with comfy couches and a stage area that has some old church pews as tables setup. There is a couple pool tables and dart boards. They have live music sometimes and serve the whole Cornish menu. Its pretty much just another part of the same restaurant, but for us locals. A part of the kitchen is behind the bar and you can see how much preparation and fresh ingredients go into these pasties. \n\nCheck out their spot on Mill Ave. also for a shot and a late night snack. They usually have the whole menu available as well. Love this restaurant like I love New York pizza. And thats a lot!!",

Being a big fan of Pasties and Shepherd/Cottage pie.. we gave it a try. The starter we ordered was some Vindaloo (I believe) hot wings. They were perfectly charred and still moist inside with a nice spicy kick.  \n\nThe main entree's we split were the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Cottage Pie. WOW! What a lovely treat when the mains came out. The Chickent Tikka Masala was quite spicy and moist without having so much juice that it made a huge mess. The yogurt sauce was a nice calming flavor to counteract the spicy red curry. Usually you do not get a real curry kick when you go to a restaurant so be aware that this is the real thing. It's wonderfully spicy for those of you with a low tolerance just order something else. For those of you who adore curry and wanted an easy and tasty new way to eat it here in the U.S. this is for you.  I only say that because it's not the usual dish served up in the U.S. while pies and pasties have been the norm in the UK forever.  Big hit #1\n\nThe second was the Cottage Pie (shepherds=beef / cottage=lamb)  and this is so perfect. A nice mild lamb flavor with a wonderful cheesy, potato mix that is served with a red wine gravy. You get all the moisture without having a dripping mess on your hands. So perfectly cooked, and filling. If you want a great comfort food this is the one. Don't be fooled when you see it, this is one filling meal. I had trouble finishing although I couldn't keep from eating more than my stomach told me to. Loved it from start to finish.  \n\nThe crust is nice and golden brown, not to thick but more than enough to keep everything inside. It's so flaky and perfect I have no complaints and had to write a review.  The photo I took is showing the Cottage Pie... the Chicken Tikka is the other half you can't see the inside of. The sauce is the yogurt sauce for the Tikka as it was dark and was the better sauce to show up in my photo. \n\nGive it a try..it's worth stepping a few blocks out of the usually higher traveled old town area. This is worth getting up and driving out of the way for when you want a comfortable setting with plenty of outdoor seating, a huge bar with what looked like  a lot of beer choices. I loved the feel and the crowd it just had even with the smaller early week crowd. It was definitely bringing a bit of that Urban fun and people that Scottsdale needs. Just get there and enjoy.",

With an incredible beer selection, nice and friendly wait staff, and incredible food, the Pasty is one of my favorite places in Tempe, hands down. \n\nTo start, get yourself one of the many awesome beers they have on tap. If you're planning on staying a while to enjoy the brand new patio (with heaters and misters), I would recommend getting an extra large glass. 32 ounces of fun. \n\nNext, go ahead and get yourself a cup of one of their awesome soups. Personal favorite: Red Pepper. Spicy, fresh, and delicious. If soup isn't your thing, I would recommend the oven chips -- oven-cooked french fries with cracked pepper. Definitely add the jalapeno. \n\nFor the main course, obviously a pasty is the way to go. My favorites include The Mexican (spiced steak strips, eggs, potatoes, jalapenos), The Royale with Cheese (hamburger, french fries, grilled onions, bacon, cheddar/swiss blend), and the Chicken Pot Pie (chicken, carrots, red potato, green beans, celery). \n\nFinish your meal off with a class Cornish Pasty desert: The Banoffee Pie. Graham cracker crust, homemade caramel with bananas, and whipped cream... If you're not melting already you should get to a past shoppe ASAP. \n\n5/5 for incredible atmosphere, food, staff, and overall experience. HIGHLY recommend.",

It's in an odd location at a strip-mall that's tucked around the corner from a decent Mexican restaurant and a sub-shop.  \n\nI'm not sure if they're going for the feel of a mineshaft, but it was ridiculously cold in there.  I'm all for beating the heat, but to go from 104 to 62 degrees was a little much for me.  \n\nI could talk more about the ambiance, which is mildly interesting, but the food is the most important thing.  I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala (Red curry) which had chicken, potato, and the red curry sauce.  The chicken was dry, as well as the curry sauce.  Mere days before I'd had Chicken red curry at George and Dragon in Phoenix, which was really good.  The pasty was not on par with that.  I have to say it was one of the more bland curries I've ever had.  Perhaps I should have tried something like their Bangers and Mash or Shepherd's Pie.\n\nAs for the price, everything on the menu should cost about 20% less.  I think Cornish Pasty is WAY overpriced.  Some of the more traditional stuff is $7 to $7.50, while everything else is $8-9.  Beer is also a little on the pricey side (20 ounce drafts are $5-6) for this kind of place.  Two Boddington's and a pasty were $18 before tax and tip.  So if you absolutely have to have a pasty then I guess this is your place, otherwise there are some other fabulous places nearby that won't break the bank.",

It's meant to be filling because the damn thing was invented for miners and as such, was never intended to be served with gravy.\n\nThings to know about the establishment itself:\n\n#1. It's dark inside for a reason - to mimic a mine, where the pasty was standard fare back in Britain, not because they're trying to be hipsters. The clientele does that.\n#2. The patio is smoker and pet friendly. Inside, the long tables and bench seats aren't particularly convenient for anyone with long legs or a rubenesque shape.\n\nReview:\n\nTried the Oggie for myself and a Porky for the little lady. She got a cup of the potato and leek soup and loved it. But with the full slice of bread it is served with, she couldn't eat the entire pasty herself. Both were quite delish, however.\n\nI was disappointed that the ONE beer (Hefeweizen) I was longing for out of the many fine selections on tap was \"out\". But, our waitress recommended I try a Hoegaarden instead. I requested a slice of orange added for good measure and found it to be an acceptable balance to the Oggie's heaviness.\n\nHonestly, I come from Wisconsin near the U.P. of Michigan and am partial to their style of pasty up in the Yoop. Not that what I had wasn't tasty, but the red wine gravy was a -- shall I say, unusual? -- flavor accompaniment. It's just a personal bias of mine.\n\nAnyone who has never had a pasty before will enjoy any selection on the menu.",

You have a tiny path to walk between tables squished up against the wall and the bar.  Behind the bar is where the employees are cramped between the ovens and the cooking area/bar making stuff up for the customers and tripping over one another trying to maneuver around in that tiny space.  Now...don't be distressed.  It was actually a good experience.\n\nI stopped in after work by myself, pulled up a seat at the bar.  A nice young lady from behind the bar came up to take my order.  I had never been here before, so had some questions.  Also, not being a huge onion fan (at least if they are really strong) I asked about the Porky, which aside from onion in the ingredient list, looked quite good.  She assured me the taste was mild and I would not notice.  I took her at her word and she was correct.  I did not notice and enjoyed my porky.  I got it along with a hard cider and garlic roasted \"chips\" (fries).  \n\nAll in all...I was impressed by the good service, very knowledgeable staff, and in general, good food.  I think I might enjoy some of the other pasties(sp?) a bit more...but the Porky was good and quite flavorful.  The fries...the garlic they baked them with didn't really stick...so it was hit and miss...but overall...still good.  My only complaint really was by the time I got a beer, meal, and fries, it was nearly $20.  $7+ for the entree, $5 for the cider, and ~$3 for the fries.  Somewhat pricey.  But otherwise, good.

It definitely gave you a sense that you were one of those miners with their pasties. Well, with a lot less arsenic and grime.\n\nMy favorite of the flaky goodness are the Meat n Cheese with HP sauce, Bangers and Mash with the wine sauce, the Cajun, Rosemary Steak. I should list the pasties I don't like.\n\n...\n\nOkay moving on to the new decor. It's dark, the chairs are church pews, the new bar is huge, and the atmosphere is a bit like a movie theatre before the previews show up. It still gets packed and people are hustling everywhere.\n\nThe service is good but there was a time where we couldn't find our server. Anywhere. The good part about the old place was that someone was always within reach if you needed anything. A few times it was even the owner!\n\nBottom line is that all of the pieces and parts in these pasties come together in an awesome sauce kind of way. The ingredients are definitely not cheap.",

There are a ton of different pasty options.  Every time I look over the menu, it's like Christmas all over again.  \n\nService can be a tad slow, but I realize that perfection isn't pre-made.  The beer selection is outstanding as well.  The staff is solid, very polite, and usually showcase a nice selection of body ink.  Don't be scared to try some apps or lighter fare.  EVERYTHING there is great.\n\nAlso, they offer half cooked Pastys.  So you can swoop in grab them and finish cooking at your leisure.  Although I usually like posting up a the bar and taking in the great crowd and atmosphere.  \n\nIt's a weekly stop for me and I don't see that slowing anytime soon.  I also frequent the location in Mesa (corner of Dobson and Guad).  It's a much larger location with a slighty more upscale feel.  Same great food and service.",

After hearing so many locals rave about the famous pastry, I had to pay the Cornish Pastry Company a visit. Talk about a British pub. This place mimics the dark, mysterious alley pubs in England. The restaurant is dim, moody and spacious with pool tables, a huge bar area and a misted patio. The vibe was very mellow on a weekday afternoon, but I can imagine it gets fairly busy on the weekends. After studying the extensive list of pastries (over two dozen), I went with the Carne Adovada from the premium list and the Cajun Chicken from the signature list and a side of the the broccoli cauliflower bake.\n\nThe broccoli cauliflower bake was delivered first. Think: healthy take on mac and cheese without giving up any of the flavor. The broccoli cauliflower dish was swimming in this wonderful cheese sauce and baked with tons of cheese on top creating a perfectly crisp exterior. Definitely delicious and a must order. \n\nThe pastries came next. Similar to a calzone but a lot less doughy, and a lot more flakey; the dough recipe is perfect because it is not overpowering to the savory delicious fillings. The Adovada was filled with simmered pork in New Mexican red chili stew, Mexican rice, hatch chilies and cheddar with a side of sour cream and salsa (the sides are switched in the photos). The pork was so tender and flavorful and the stew and chilies added a perfect kick. This was a British take on a Mexican influenced dish and it was a winner. The Cajun Chicken was filled with spicy cajun chicken breast, bacon, ham and Swiss and served with a side of chipotle sauce. The chicken was tender and the bacon added the right amount of smokiness paired with the chipotle sauce. I enjoyed this pastry as well, but the Adovada was the winner.\n\nWith so many options to choose from, you really can't go wrong here. I spend about fifteen minutes on the menu trying to decide which pasty to choose. There is something for everyone here with flavors ranging form Spanish influence, to Indian influence, to Mediterranean influence. The service was on point as well. We were directed to the main seating area by the host and the waitress took time to point out some of her favorites on the menu. She didn't seem to be very knowledgable on what each pasty included and the sauces were switched on my pastries, but all was forgiven after the first bite. There is a large private parking lot for the restaurant with free parking available. I'll be back next time I'm in town.",

At the end of the 3rd day, I had seen enough food to feed the LSU National champion football team.  I could out fast Les or Bear on their survivor shows\n\nDinner time was approaching.....My business associate and I couldn't face a full course dinner for at least another 24 hours...but we knew we had to eat something so we wouldnt wake up at 3 am famished.  I remembers reading about this place in Yelp that would be perfect for our situation....so remembering some favorable Yelp reviews in Phoenix  I said to him:\n\n\"How about pastys for dinner?\"\n\nHe went from a relaxed and carefree disposition to a stunned and shocked demeanor.   He looked me like I was from another planet and his glance indicated doubt about my integrity.

Have you ever had one.?\"\n\nStill thinking of the long vowel version, he hesitated a little and answered with a \"No\" veiled with a lot of doubt and concern.\n\n\"Good.   That's where we're going.\"    As I glanced over to him, I could see a sense of curiousity, dispair and expectation of upcoming chaos.\n\nWe arrived at 7:45 pm.   It's dark everywhere.   In the street, in the parking lot.   We enter the restaurant and it's no brighter.   \n\nIt is a very narrow and long restaurant with just enough room for seats at the bar nearly the length of the store and small side tables on the side.  The interior decoration theme is obvious here.   Build the biggest bar that would fit in this row house type of store, and accessorize the rest of the restaurant around the bar.  \n\nSitting in a very dark restaurant, with Beatle music blaring away, this English pub type of place had a huge variety of pastys....from traditional steak and potatoes, to bangers and mash, to more contempory selections that include vegetarian, curries, and fish.   They have a huge selection of international beers, many of which are of the UK......duhhh.\n\nI wanted to eat \"light\" so I selected the Lovely Bit a Salmon which is\nAtlantic Salmon in a white wine cream & dill sauce, sauted asparagus, spinach, roasted red potatoes, spinach and roasted tomatoes. \n\nWHAT A GREAT DISH.   Everything was layered carefully inside the pasty which was served cut in half.  The salmon was cooked perfectly.  The asparagus was not over cooked but had a crunch.   All the flavors blended well together.   I still wasn't hungry so I took one half of it back to the hotel....and had it for breakfast the following morning......which tasted just great.\n\nMy buddy had Spicy Asiago Chicken which was spicy chicken, roasted corn, black beans, asiago cheese, hatch chilies, and Mexican stewed tomatoes with a side of sour cream & salsa.   That too was excellent.\n\nIf ever in Phoenix, this would be worth any drive to have lunch or dinner and a beer.\n\nAfter dinner I asked him if he would return to eat here and he said he readily would.

Now you may be saying \"But Connor, I've had bread pudding and I don't like it.\" That's fine. It's literally like no other bread pudding.

She already has the \"Pilgrim\" pastie picked out as her next one to try and at about $9/meal, I bet she'll have worked through most of the menu by the time I see her again.\n\nDefinitely put this on your \"must see\" list of places to eat (for lunch)!",

Expect to sit alongside your mates and clip your bag to the bar as the place is truly tiny. Husband also got a light ale. \nRight away they wanted to take the order, but the menu is a fun adventure and as a first visit I really wanted to read all the selections. My family was starving so they just couldn't wait for me to meander over the varieties and the waitress was really eager to get moving. She said take your time, but she stood right there and so, I did feel a bit rushed. As a result I didn't order a side salad which I think would have made me happier.\nI was wondering if the Pasty was going to be enough, was it going to be soggy or burnt, was the crust going to be doughy or dry?  I mean I'm naturally a skeptical critic, why else would I Yelp? But my Pasty was perfect. It was not greasy, it was flaky but firm in the right parts, it wasn't burnt anywhere it was divine. My Pasty was not chock full of air pockets it was chock full of filling. My daughter could only eat half (she's 9) but the adults were perfectly satisfied without being bloated.\nI could bring my veggie friends/family here too.\nI knocked a star off because despite being not too busy we waited and waited to close out our check. She was too fast taking the order, and too slow to close us out. We didn't get to order any dessert because of our long wait with empty plates. Despite the unevenness of the service no one was rude or unpleasant and the pocket was so good we'll come back.  Next time I'm going to have the Reuben stuffed in there, my daughter wants to try the meatball and my husband just might have a Pilgrim (Thanksgiving in your hands! Lovely!) I know everyone can find a Pasty that they would like to eat here and I encourage you to go!\nUpdate: We did go back and have the above selections and I got a Chicken Tikka salad to share. Fabulous! I enjoyed the second visit even more. The Pilgrim is undeniably yum, the Reuben was chockfull of flavor, the meatball delighted my daughter but was so-so for me. The Indian spiced chicken was so tasty I wish they made it into a Pasty too. They do Lamb Vindaloo, so why not? I still recommend this place and will likely return a thrid time... so yummy.",

ALL of them.  There are only a few of the veggie pasties I haven't tried.  Outside of the original and traditional ones, though, the Rosemary Chicken and the Pilgrim have to be my favorites.  There's no need for side dishes or appetizer breads or anything, since every delicious bite you need comes wrapped up neatly in an egg-brushed pastry pocket fresh out of the oven.  It's exactly the right amount of food.\n\nThe owner is an extremely friendly, knowledgeable, and cool fella, and he's always looking at ways to make his business better.  He's chosen a great crew to meet the increasing demands of this growing hot spot, since everyone who works there is nice and down-to-earth.  I've never seen a single employee lounging or wasting time there.\n\nWhat they do really, really well:  (1) All of the FOOD, including the salads and desserts.  (2) The beer selection is incredible, full of tasty imports and domestics both on tap and in bottles.  (3) The prices are excellent.  (4) The decor is sleek and modern, complete with classic rock playing at a quiet yet audible volume.\n\nWhat they could improve on:  There's very little room for parties of 4.  There's plenty of counter space, a handful of tables for 2, and a custom table for 3 that's kind of neat, but the small area at the back that used to be smaller tables is now one large table.  Parties of 4 now take up the whole area (that could seat up to 8), making it awkward for any other big parties coming in.  Plus, you can't cut through tables to sit on the bench side of the booth anymore.  You have to scoot down the length of the table and then push everyone out again if you have to get up for any reason.  (A very small fault, considering that everything else about the place is incredible!)\n\nOverall, this is one of Tempe's best little restaurants.  Whenever I'm not craving food from a particular location, pasties have become the default food for my whole household.  They're always tasty and we just never get tired of them.  I have to move out of state soon, and of all the places we've eaten in our 10 years here, I will miss the Cornish Pasty Company the most!!!",

Usually dark and small places make me claustrophobic but I actually liked the atmosphere. It was like a comfy cave. And I loved the fact that I smelled curry in a pub. \n\nIt took about 10 minutes to get any service. Which slightly annoyed me because if we would have gotten served earlier we would have gotten happy hour prices on our beers. But luckily the server was great. Really sweet, funny, and informative. \n\nThe pasties do take awhile to be made, but that's okay because we had 32 oz beers to enjoy! They have a good, but not huge beer selection.\n\nMy husband ordered the oggie which he really enjoyed. He loved the sauce it came with. I ordered the pesto veggie pasty. It was very tasty. The pasty itself it so buttery and flaky. And the filling had Quorn brand veggie chicken which is my favorite brand of vegetarian chicken. So yummy. Next time I definitely want to order a spicier one. Italian style was good but I can imagine a Mexican or Indian one being even better!\n\nOverall, worth the 20 minute trek to Tempe!",

And, oh yeah, us, the regular \"normal\" folks.\n\nWe got seated at a long bench, and the first thing we were told is that they were out of multiple items. Argh! that's always disappointing.  Two of us got soft drinks (soda + root beer), and they were FLAT. As in nary a bubble to be seen flat.  We told the waitress, and it was about 10 minutes later with some fresh bubbly sodas.\n\nDid I mention they were out of a ton of things? We eventually ended up with potato wedges (out of the fries), lamb pasty, thanksgiving pasty, leak + potato soup, and english toffee pudding. Why do establishments think it's cute to rename products which already have a perfectly acceptable name (I'm looking at you, starbucks)? \n\nBefore the food could come out, they seated a party of 7 LARGE individuals at our communal bench. We are a party of 4 normal to slender individuals, but the amount of human flesh pushed up to us was ridiculous.  There's personal space, and then there's hello, you are practically in my lap! Seriously, their party should have gotten a whole communal table to themselves because it was absurd.\n\nFood came - it was hot, and everyone seemed happy. I had the toffee pudding with vanilla ice cream. Really enjoyable, but it's hard to eat when your arms are squished by your side due to overflowing human flesh that's not yours, or your friend's.

To begin, the place itself is really dark (kind of divey) which I'm not a huge fan of. Others would probably like it, but at 1pm, I want there to be a little bit of light in a building so I can see what I'm eating, others at the table, etc. \n\nThe pasty was \"ok\" in my opinion. The pastry itself is flaky and was pretty good. It seemed though that the filling varied at the table --depending on what you order, you may get something dry. I ended up getting a pasty that was supposed to be filled with spicy chicken and green chile but the chicken wasn't that spicy. The chile was just \"ok\" considering that we're in the southwest. \n\nDrinks seemed expensive (and I'm talking about sodas here) and they charge for refills? I ended up getting a water. \n\nOverall, I wasn't as impressed as others clearly are. Maybe we came at a bad day/time for the pasty.

It's like the best pot pie crust wrapped completely around a variety of different combinations. The crust alone is fantastic, and when you put those fillings in it, I couldn't get enough.\n\nWhen I walked into this place, I kind of wondered where I had gotten myself. The Tempe location is nearly pitch black inside. On a positive note, it's a nice place to go in the middle of the hot summer here, because it was nice and cool inside. There's also a nice porch to eat outside if the weather permits. Seating is on a \"help yourself\" basis, and I think this may lend itself towards the servers not necessarily noticing you immediately. That's what happened to us, both at the beginning and the end of our meal.\n\nI had the Pilgrim pasty, which is essentially a Thanksgiving meal all wrapped inside a pastyl. It has turkey, grilled onions, sweet potatoes, chicken, and stuffing, and is served with a red wine gravy and cranberry sauce. I'm a sucker for cranberry sauce and for Thanksgiving in general, and this totally hit the spot!

With an incredible beer selection, nice and friendly wait staff, and incredible food, the Pasty is one of my favorite places in Tempe, hands down. \n\nTo start, get yourself one of the many awesome beers they have on tap. If you're planning on staying a while to enjoy the brand new patio (with heaters and misters), I would recommend getting an extra large glass. 32 ounces of fun. \n\nNext, go ahead and get yourself a cup of one of their awesome soups. Personal favorite: Red Pepper. Spicy, fresh, and delicious. If soup isn't your thing, I would recommend the oven chips -- oven-cooked french fries with cracked pepper. Definitely add the jalapeno. \n\nFor the main course, obviously a pasty is the way to go. My favorites include The Mexican (spiced steak strips, eggs, potatoes, jalapenos), The Royale with Cheese (hamburger, french fries, grilled onions, bacon, cheddar/swiss blend), and the Chicken Pot Pie (chicken, carrots, red potato, green beans, celery). \n\nFinish your meal off with a class Cornish Pasty desert: The Banoffee Pie. Graham cracker crust, homemade caramel with bananas, and whipped cream... If you're not melting already you should get to a past shoppe ASAP. \n\n5/5 for incredible atmosphere, food, staff, and overall experience. HIGHLY recommend.",

Sweet!\n\nThis location is definitely set up with the college kids in mind. Inside is very dark with black painted ceiling tiles and walls. Looks like the basement of a really old bar or maybe even a coal mine. Great place to gather up with the crew and down a few pints and then chow down on some tasty grub.\n\nTheir west side entrance has a long sit down bar with a few small tables and is rather cramped. The east side entrance has more of a full seating area with additional bar seating. Recommend using the east side one unless you are going undercover and need a quick escape.\n\nStarted with a cup of Cream of Leek, Potato & Stilton soup. It came with bread and butter and was very good. Ordered the Peppered Steak Pasty which is filled with Sirloin Steak, sautéed Portobello Mushrooms, Leeks, roasted Zucchini, and Stilton Bleu Cheese. It also came with a side of yummy Peppercorn Brandy Cream sauce.\n\nEverything was very satisfying. There are so many different versions of what they can make. Lamb, Chicken, Pork, Beef, and Veggie are just some of the fillings. I suppose you could make a check list and try them all. Hmmm?\n\nDon't forget some Dessert if you still have room. Can't wait to explore more of their delicious menu. Would probably go to the new Scottsdale location or the Mesa one on my next visit. Same great food with more lighting and better suited for a blind old fogey like me. PARTY ON TEMPE!\n\n3.75 STARS",

So much so that after eating there one night, we returned the night after for another round!\n\nWe sampled quite a few things from their menu...the Royale with Cheese was badass, the Chicken Alfredo pleasant, the Cajun wickedly delicious and spicy...and don't forget the Pilgrim, which is like having Thanksgiving bundled up and delivered to you in a wonderfully delicious pasty package.  AND the portions are big enough that you can eat half and be full, so the goodness can be enjoyed as a heated up lunch the next day!  BUT WAIT, THERE IS MORE!  We couldn't resist dessert...\n\nNight One:  Banoffee Pie.  Thick layer of graham cracker, wickedly thick layer of RICH caramel, a spattering of banana slices and then fresh whipped cream.  FREAKIN AWESOME.\n\nAND IT GETS EVEN BETTER!!!!\n\nNight Two:  Peanut Butter and Jelly Pasty.  Imagine amazing pastry smothered in chunky peanut butter, drizzled with raspberry jelly and encasing bananas...now top that with some more pastry, more jelly and whipped cream...not the sickening sweet shit that comes in cans...fresh, cool awesomeness disguised as a white blob.  THIS is the amazing Peanut Butter and Jelly Pasty...God's gift to man.  \n\nMy advice...SEEK OUT CORNISH PASTY CO, ALL YE FOOD LOVERS!!!  You will NOT be disappointed.",

And their pasties are SPOT ON.\n\nIf you've ever had a pasty from the West Cornwall Pasty Co. in the UK, you'll recognize the pasties on CPC's menu. They have your traditional steak and swede (CPC: The Oggie), Pork and Apple, and other familiar favorites. They also have some of their own creations, which sound amazing.\n\nI ordered the Oggie. Husband ordered the Meat (housemade sage sausage) and Cheese. Outstanding flavor, texture, and overall eatability. They're huge--we each took half home and they heated up fabulously in the oven at 350F the next day.\n\nDON'T SKIP DESSERT! The Banoffee Pie is a favorite across the pond and an absolute must-try. It's incredibly rich--and incredibly large--so plan to share between two or more!\n\nOh, and hey--the service is outstanding, and the prices can't be beat. Win, win, win!",

I decided on the vegan eggplant parmesan and although I was under the impression I specifically asked for no cheese, vegan or not, I received it.

The food is last-meal-on-earth worthy.\n\nI cannot, however, give Cornish Pasty Co. five stars, because the service is sooo hit or miss. I will deal with slow service for the food, but good gravy I wish they'd get a clue on this point. Sometimes I go there and it's wonderful--I get my booze, food and check in a time frame reasonable for human living. Other times, I convince people I know to try the place out and we're literally there for two and a half hours while the one server working at the time roams the entire place and spends half the time chatting. \n\nI read a lot of yelp reviews of places I love and think people are being entitled jerks about the service and they should never leave corporate franchise places.

Large and in charge, I was able to take half of it home for leftovers.\n\nAtmosphere is good, gets busy so get there early especially if you're meeting others.\n\nThey have other items like soup and salads which all looked pretty good but I had to have the Cubano. It was tasty.",

If you care about nothing else except the taste of your food--go here.\n\nIf you care about things like: customer service and appropriate wait times (at the University location, not the other one), I would suggest not vising this restaurant.\n\nI've had many experiences with Cornish Pasty. My friends love it, and when it comes to the food, I love it too. (Especially the pork pasty.)\n\nI've only had one good one though--and that was when I sat directly at the bar and told the woman standing there what I wanted. \n\nThe a few of the other times happened something like this:\n\n1. Went in alone, waited fifteen minutes for anyone to come over and even wipe down my table, let alone ask for a drink or dinner order.\n\n2. Went there with 4 other friends, waited 2 hours for a table, and the gentleman acting the 'host' was especially rude when we would ask him about how long he thought it would be (roughly ever 30 minutes) and he always said \"Looks like 15 more minutes.\" Then when we were finally seated our drinks came back half empty and my pasty was cold in the center.\n\nThe truth is, is that while the food is great the company needs to retrain it's workers. Customer service should be at the top of their list, and from what I can tell it's at the bottom.",

I'm a fan of tattoos and this style, even though I don't appear to be, so I was digging it. One side is a bar scene with pool and other games (briefly walked through); the other side was the restaurant. They have booths, tables and 'breakfast nooks'; host told us to sit wherever. \n\nService:\nA few different people approached us throughout our dining experience and all were nice. Two were very attentive, but one first forgot the lemon for our waters and didn't ask if I wanted more water each time she approached (so I asked since my cup was empty and sitting at the edge of the table - I thought this was the unspoken universal signal for 'please refill me' but perhaps she's new to serving lol). \n\nMenu:\nVery clear and not busy. I like that cuz some menus need to be revamped. So many choices, but I narrowed it down to four pastries quickly based on what I prefer. The Porky, Italian, All Day English Breakfast and the Lamb & Mint. I opted for the latter and overall was happy with my selection (one of my friends also went for this one and she liked it). \n\nFood:\nCame out warm and smelling delicious (of course I had to snap it first). I wanted to try it without the sauce and it was good, but not tasty. Adding the Red Wine Gravy made it very tasty so it makes sense there's not too much flavor before adding it (ate 1/2 with this gravy). My other friend was having one of the steak ones and his came with Peppercorn Brandy Cream Sauce so I asked for a side for my second half. Sooooo good! I did try a bite of the blue cheese steak pastry he had and very tasty to me, but you must love blue cheese if ordering that one FYI otherwise they said it's too overbearing (perfect for me and blue cheese lovers tho). \n\nRestroom: \nNot very pretty in there, but I wouldn't expect it to be in a hipster dive type bar. The stalls were not painted by an artist, lol, but the bright color choice was a good try. I hope all the graffiti was written when there wasn't a line since there's only two stalls. I'm thinking AZ doesn't have the law enforcing toilet seat covers. They had toilet paper, soap, working toilets (oh wait one out of the two was out of order), and running water...so that's really all that matters I suppose. The owner had a sweet long note pulled from Facebook on the wall (it was thanking the community/customers for their continued support) and I would have taken a pic, but left my phone back at the booth. \n\nOverall it was a good experience so I tipped well and didn't have leftovers.",

I guess they prefer a total BAR atmosphere ! After surveying the menu for 15 minutes I decided on the Philly Cheese Steak Pastie and my friend went traditional with the Shepherds Pie.\nLet me say we were NOT disappointed, the Pasties were fresh and yummy delicious, mine came with a mustard cream sauce as well as their red wine gravy that I had asked for. I prefer the gravy ! My friends Shepherds Pie with Lamb and the wine gravy was also yummy. After a short walk around I was surprised to see all of these wonderful pie's were being made FRESH behind a short order/bar environment. Yes just like we used to see in the drug stores, a griddle and gas fired 4 burner stove and a tiny convection oven If you've never had a pastie, its basically like a calzone but uses a pastry crust. There were over 25 different variations with several great looking desserts, we decided on the homemade bread pudding, more chocolate brownie tasting then traditional bread pudding, but tasty all the same.\nThere prices were fair for the Tempe area, $9.50 and $9.75 respectively and the bread pudding was $7.50.\nI am looking forward to dining there again when they are not out of their homemade sausage.\nIf you don't care for a Bar atmosphere, loud music, dark and dingy then you should steer clear or set outside.\nI should add that I found it extremely odd that they used old church pews for a large part of their seating.",

I am already looking forward to going back and trying another one of their delicious concoctions.\n\nYou can also buy their pasties uncooked so you can make them at home!",

            "text": "It has been a LONG TIME since I have been to this place, but I would love to put my 10 cents in.  First off, before eating here I didn't even know meat pies existed.  It was like an awesome burrito but with a flaky crust and WAY more choices.  When I lived in Tempe I was a terribly picky eater and every single time I came in I got the same thing, the meatball pasty.  It was awesome, everytime.  Everything on the menu looks delicious and it looks like the flavors blend together very well.  They are premade before you get there, so you cant really have them take ingredients out, although I am sure if you let them know ahead of time it can be arranged.\n\nSo there are 2 things I would like to talk about here.  First, the atmosphere.  Walking in you have a tiny restaurant that has a bar on one side and some small tables against the wall.  All the waiters are tatted up and lend an air of ruggedness to the joint.  As you sit at the bar, they are right in front of you rolling up the pasties and behind them are the stoves that they bake your pies in after you order them.  So basically you are sitting at a bar, drinking a cold beer and you can feel the heat from the ovens.  In some places this would be annoying, but again I feel like it lends greatness to the atmosphere.  The music is usually some good British rock and once again, yes, lends to the atmosphere.  So I enjoy feeling like I am in some tiny pub in Cornwall.\n\nSecond, THE DESSERT!  I will start with the Strawberry Pavlova which I could have done without.  The meringue shell is light and unless that is your cup of tea, keep on reading.  The PB&J pasty I only had one time and it was good, but second rate for me compared to the next two items.  Next up is the caramel apple pasty.  Delish!  Apple and caramel baked into the pie shell and topped with ice cream.  However nothing in this world can touch the BANOFFEE Pie!  Dig this real quick, a thick graham cracker pie crust.  Top that with caramel.  Top that with whipped cream and top that with bananas.  Oh, and if you are crazy ask them for strawberries too...and ice cream.  Now eat that and tell me you've had a better dessert.  I sure as hell havent!",

The pasties are very nicely priced with how much food you get. Honestly, I usually take half of it home to eat later (if you do take it home, I'd recommend heating it up in the toaster oven). If you need pasty recommendations, I'd recommend the cajun, portobello mushroom, and cheese steak. The desserts are also delicious. So, in conclusion, come into Cornish Pasty and enjoy the world of classy hot pockets.",

It's hamburger, cheese, onion, mushrooms bacon, and the best part - fries all snuggled into a flaky pasty crust. I like to dip mine into ranch for that classic burger tastiness.\nThe Pilgrim is thanksgiving dinner. It's turkey, sweet potatoes, stuffing and onions. Served with a side of cranberries and gravy. \nI always have a hard time choosing between the two because they are both so delicious. \n\nThe place itself has a cool, laid back vibe and the staff is always friendly.\n\nThe pasties do take a while to make though so expect to wait a while. These are not fast food in any sense of the term. If you are in a hurry, this is not the place for you. Especially at lunch.\n\nAlso, their seating is really best set up for groups of two.  This is not a \"take the whole family out for dinner\" kinda place. They have a couple tables in the back that can seat four but the majority of tables are two-tops and then there is space at the bar.\n\nNo question, Cornish Pasty Company is one of my favorite places in the valley.",

I like this location because it is the original.  \nThis time I decided to skip the appetizer to save room for dessert.  I still had the usual very large Hoegaarden to start and ordered the very new and not on the menu \"Spicy BBQ Chicken Pasty\". Anything with spicy and BBQ deserves a shot and it was delicious.  \nThe chicken was tender and juicy, the BBQ sauce had some kick to it, the jalapeño and grilled onions were a great touch.  I am not sure yet if this may be a new favorite but if it weren't, it would be a close second.  Only one thing could make this night more perfect....well....maybe two things but I will settle for the Banoffee pie.\nIt has been a while since I had the Banoffee pie and I don't know why.  Who doesn't love graham cracker crust, homemade caramel, bananas and fresh whipped cream?  With every spoon full you get everything, the crust is incredible, the caramel is sweet, the whipped cream is delicious and the bananas are perfect.  I was only able to eat half of it so I brought the other half home with me.\nAnother perfect meal from a great place to eat, drink and be satisfied....anywho.

Remember when I said I was starving? Well, I start to get a little cranky when I'm hungry, and our server was not making any rounds to see how her tables were doing. After fifteen or so minutes, I decide to go over to where our server is talking with another server, and ask for more bread, nicely of course. Once she comes back with our bread, the soup is cold, but I don't really mind. I was just happy she put more bread in front of me. A few minutes later our pasty comes out. She had obviously forgotten about our salad (guess that's what happens when you don't write anything down) so I reminded her and she comes back shortly with it. Only after we had been sitting there for ten minutes after we had finished everything and the busser, who was much friendly than our server, had already cleared the table, did our server appear from the darkness and we were finally able to get our check, pay, and leave.

Maybe they keep it dark for a reason.\n\nIt's not like I'm expecting five star service or anything, I get that it's a bar too. But come on. If you're the type that doesn't like their server to stop by a lot, or you don't need any refills, then this place would be perfect for you.",

The only pasty I didn't like was one with an ingredient I don't like, so I can't blame them.  I'm not even sure if they have other food, because I always get a pasty or two.\n\nThe beer selection is good, and the staff are great and very friendly.  The only downside is that this place is cramped and it can be hard to find a seat at times; there's only one table that can accommodate a crowd (+ the bar).

It's like the English version of an empanada, or like a gourmet hot pocket, haha! (ok, it really doesn't compare to a hot pocket, I'm sorry, I'm just trying to think of a good word picture!)\n\nSo, they have a million different filling options...it seems what is available on the menu might vary depending on what is fresh (LOVE food made to order that's FRESH!) The best part about this place is that they have VEGAN OPTIONS! woo hoo!!! I'm adding this place to my dairy-safe zone! \n\nI had the vegan philly cheese steak pasty, it was very good! They really do make it fresh, mine was piping hot....for the \"steak\" they used mushrooms, and whatever kind of sauce they used for the \"cheese\" was quite savory. When you order your pasty, they give you some different sauce-on-the-side options (apparently you eat pasty with sauce?) Anyways, the marinara was really good and really complemented my pasty. (a beer would have worked really well with it too.... oh well, next time!)\n\nMy husband had the oggie and thoroughly enjoyed it was well. These things are big, by the way! If you have trouble filling up, you'll be really happy with this place! And if you don't, you'll have two meals for the day for only around 10 bucks! Not bad, right?!\n\nCan't wait to come back here! Btw, this location is designed to look like inside a mine (read the menu for the background story on pasties) If you are claustrophobic, just sit towards the back, there is a nice big window back there.

            "text": "I am reviewing the original Tempe location.  Given all the great reviews this place has gotten, I was wondering what I could add that hasn't already been said.  It's not only the only place in Tempe you can get a cornish pasty, but they are also freak'n awesome.  The Lovely Bit of Salmon was my favorite, but alas given my newly discovered gluten intolerance I am not able to part-take in such loveliness any more:  :(\n\nBut nevertheless, I still come here every now and then with my friends and husband.  They all chow down on the yummy pasties while I chow down on my salads, sides, and soups.  So, I decided to concentrate my review on those items. (Some of these dishes are not gluten free.  I had them before I found out about my gluten intolerance.) \n\nSoups:\nThey offer a variety of soups.  I have tried: 1) the cream of leek, potato, and stilton, 2) the cream of tomato and crouton, and 3) the red pepper, black bean, rice, chicken, and jalapeno.  They were all very good, but I was informed that only the red pepper one is gluten free.  I had the first two before I found out about my gluten intolerance.  Not only are their soups really tasty, full of flavor, they are all also accompanied by thick slices of fresh bread and butter, baked and churned in-house.  Absolutely delicious!  The are perfect accompaniments, and a bowl at $4.75 would make a tasty and light lunch that won't break the bank.  \n\nSides: \nThe garlic mashed potatoes and the garlic roasted potatoes are also very good.  Pretty much what you should expect.  Creamy mashed potatoes and nicely roasted red potatoes with a hint of garlic.  Not too garlicky.  \n\nThe mushy peas is one of my favorite side dishes that they serve.  I think I prefer them to the potatoes simply because they are something different that I can't get anywhere else.  And these ain't  no ordinary peas.  They are huge for peas.  Cooked really well.  Not too mushy (overcooked), even though they are \"mushy\" peas. There is a great texture and freshness to this dish.  The texture of these \"mushy peas\" is more like crunchy peanut butter than creamy peanut butter if we were speaking of peanut butter that is (it's an analogy. . . just go with it), and I think the freshness and the texture go hand in hand from not overcooking the peas.  \n\nThe broccoli and cauliflower cheese bake is also a nice dish.  It makes me think of mac'n cheese, but with cauliflower and broccoli instead of mac noodles.  I dont think this dish is gluten free.  It seems to be made with a cheese sauce that is thickened with a flour rue, then baked to give a nice golden, crusted top.  It was tasty as well, but could have used a bit more seasoning.  It was my least favorite of all the sides I have had. \n\nAll their salads are also pretty good.  The veggies in the salad are pretty much the same regardless of which salad you get: ice berg lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and onions.  Except for the Greek and pasta.  The Greek has feta and olives, and the pasta has a whole list of its own ingredients.  \n\nWhat differentiates the various salads are the additions and the dressing.  Beside the basic garden and Greek, the three other salads to choose from are: 1) the salmon or chicken caesar, 2) the chicken tikka salad, and 3) the sausage salad.  The salmon caesar is a great substitute for the Lovely Bit of Salmon pasty.  The salmon is cooked very well.  Juicy, not overcooked and not undercooked, seasoned just like the salmon in the Lovely Bit of Salmon.  Ask for a side of the white wine and dill dressing that usually accompanies the Lovely Bit of Salmon and you will not regret it.  That sauce is amazing.  This is my favorite salad. The chicken tikka is also good.  The chicken is marinated in a red rub or spice, like what you would find with tandoori chicken, and served on a salad with yogurt dressing.  Finally, the sausage salad was not my favorite.  They make the sausage in house, but I was a bit disappointed with the flavor and the way it was cooked.  It was overcooked, very dry, and a bit off.  I'm not sure if I would order it again.  I've had it twice and it was the same both times.\n\nOverall, this is one of the best restaurants in Tempe!",

We ended up just picking what kind of appeared to be an entry.  We found out later that we went in through the side which used to be the main entrance, but was too small.  Within a few steps we noticed a very bad smell, but it went away after we kept walking.  We found out later that the smell is from a special kind of cave cheese they keep back there.  The smell was gross and made me think \"turn around and leave,\" but just then we were greeted by a friendly waitress who told us to sit where ever we wanted.  I was surprised at how dark it was in there.\n\nI started with the potato cheese soup.  It was wonderful, but the fresh baked bread really added a nice compliment to it.  I had the shepherd's pie pasty with red wine sauce.  It was super delicious!  The crust was perfectly flaky, the lamb was tender and tasty, and that sauce was so flavorful!  \n\nI almost didn't order a desert for two reasons: #1 my husband isn't much of a desert person (and by this time I was so full I didn't think I could finish one by myself.)  And # 2 I was slightly concerned about my waistline.  I went ahead and did it anyway because I wasn't sure when I would get to go back.  I AM SO GLAD I ORDERED the toffee pudding!  It comes fresh baked so it takes a little while...wait dang it, you will not regret it.\n  \nIt was not the kind of pudding I expected at all.  It appeared to be a little chocolate cake in a cast iron mini cauldron and to its side was a nice pour of creme anglaise.  I first tried just the cake and it was yummy, but then I began to slowly drizzle the creme over the cake watching it soak into it like a sponge.  The next bite was unbelievable!  It was so warm and soft and moist and sweet I thought I'd explode!\n\nOverall, the whole experience was an A.

At the end of the 3rd day, I had seen enough food to feed the LSU National champion football team.  I could out fast Les or Bear on their survivor shows\n\nDinner time was approaching.....My business associate and I couldn't face a full course dinner for at least another 24 hours...but we knew we had to eat something so we wouldnt wake up at 3 am famished.  I remembers reading about this place in Yelp that would be perfect for our situation....so remembering some favorable Yelp reviews in Phoenix  I said to him:\n\n\"How about pastys for dinner?\"\n\nHe went from a relaxed and carefree disposition to a stunned and shocked demeanor.   He looked me like I was from another planet and his glance indicated doubt about my integrity.   Then with a delayed but dry smile he spoke up and said....\n\n\"Aren't those things they wear at the.....\"\n\n\"NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!    Not pasties......pastys.\"   I retorted quickly before the people in the lobby heard the next nouns he was just about to utter.   \"Pasty's with a short vowel, not long.   Have you ever had one.?\"\n\nStill thinking of the long vowel version, he hesitated a little and answered with a \"No\" veiled with a lot of doubt and concern.\n\n\"Good.   That's where we're going.\"    As I glanced over to him, I could see a sense of curiousity, dispair and expectation of upcoming chaos.\n\nWe arrived at 7:45 pm.   It's dark everywhere.   In the street, in the parking lot.   We enter the restaurant and it's no brighter.   \n\nIt is a very narrow and long restaurant with just enough room for seats at the bar nearly the length of the store and small side tables on the side.  The interior decoration theme is obvious here.   Build the biggest bar that would fit in this row house type of store, and accessorize the rest of the restaurant around the bar.  \n\nSitting in a very dark restaurant, with Beatle music blaring away, this English pub type of place had a huge variety of pastys....from traditional steak and potatoes, to bangers and mash, to more contempory selections that include vegetarian, curries, and fish.   They have a huge selection of international beers, many of which are of the UK......duhhh.\n\nI wanted to eat \"light\" so I selected the Lovely Bit a Salmon which is\nAtlantic Salmon in a white wine cream & dill sauce, sauted asparagus, spinach, roasted red potatoes, spinach and roasted tomatoes. \n\nWHAT A GREAT DISH.   Everything was layered carefully inside the pasty which was served cut in half.  The salmon was cooked perfectly.  The asparagus was not over cooked but had a crunch.   All the flavors blended well together.   I still wasn't hungry so I took one half of it back to the hotel....and had it for breakfast the following morning......which tasted just great.\n\nMy buddy had Spicy Asiago Chicken which was spicy chicken, roasted corn, black beans, asiago cheese, hatch chilies, and Mexican stewed tomatoes with a side of sour cream & salsa.   That too was excellent.\n\nIf ever in Phoenix, this would be worth any drive to have lunch or dinner and a beer.\n\nAfter dinner I asked him if he would return to eat here and he said he readily would.    Then I detected a slight pause and a curl of a smile in the background.........maybe he was fantasizing buying a long vowel...",

The seating could be a bit more comfortable but the lighting and the hipster feel of the place is strangely calming. The menu is massive and surprisingly includes an entirely vegetarian section as well. I usually order the Mexican which comes with choice of vegetarian beef or regular. I decided to give vegetarian a try. I was certainly surprised. We ordered an appetizer of curried potatoes and baked beans and they were amazing. Finally we finished the meal with some beers and a desert of bread pudding. My one complaint is that they still don't have mushy peas. However, this is one of the few places that I insist on taking people new to the east valley.",

The mixture of chicken, cheese, beans, corn, and salsa inside had a nice and slightly spicy Mexican flare. The pasty was something like $6 and plenty for one person. The food is definitely the high point for this place.\n\nThe place was very busy when we arrived with about 8 people and we had to wait a long time to snatch a table (we were on \"the list\" but they don't appear to actually honor any such arrangements versus a free-for-all). There was also only one server running around the whole place, so it was difficult to place orders, get refills, remove leftover encrusted plates, etc. The drinks are priced relatively low and there were many types of beers on tap, which probably makes it a popular place for the college crowd. \n\nOverall, this might be a nice place to actually dine if it had better service and wasn't such a dive bar rather than an eatery. It would be nice if there were separate areas for a dinning room and bar. Right now, it seems like it really wants to be a bar, but it happens to randomly serve some good food.",

I've never seen it on tap before, so we were pretty excited to try it. It did not disappoint! We ordered our pasties; I had the bangers and mash and my husband had the chicken tikka masala. I think we'd agree that they were both good, but nothing mind-blowing.  My husband is from England and thought the sausages didn't taste authentic. They were extremely sage-y and a bit tough. I was a bit disappointed that the \"mash\" was really just chunks of potatoes. The red wine gravy served on the side was good. \n\nI think it was a bit pricey for what we got - two pasties and two beers for $28. I wouldn't make a special trip to Tempe to have it again.",

I have always loved their food and (once I was old enough to drink), their beer selection, but over the past year I have noticed a severe decline in service.  It has gotten so bad that, after last night, I am afraid to say that I do not plan on returning to this restaurant again.\n\nI live right down the street from Cornish Pasty Co., and have dined in and gotten carry-out whenever I could convince my boyfriend to go for their food (he apparently doesn't crave their pasty selection as much as I do).  We've sat at the bar and it's been decent service, but when ordering carry-out and dining in the restaurant, I've noticed service worsening, and becoming rude and dismissive.  \n\nTo begin with, there is no signage upon entering the restaurant, so you just have to know whether or not to seat yourself or go to the back to pick up a carryout order.  (I suppose it's the hipster thing nowadays).  The last time I went to pick up carry out, I was summarily ignored by at least three servers before butting in on one of their conversations to state that I was there to pick up an order.  Their attitudes across the board were unfriendly, and they did not acknowledge the presence of either me, or the other customers waiting to get their orders for carry out.\n\nLast night, my boyfriend and I decided to give them another try to dine-in.  After standing in the doorway for about a minute (we couldn't remember if we could just seat ourselves or not), a server acknowledged us in a friendly manner and invited us to sit anywhere.  After choosing a seat, we waited over five minutes (during this time tracking down our own menus and beer lists), while 2 different bussers walked past us twice, and 3 different servers walked past our area.  During this time, no one acknowledged us, no busser brought us water (despite walking straight past our area with a water pitcher).  After a busser brought water to a group that had literally just sat down, we decided to just leave.  My boyfriend informed the manager of the poor service on our way out, and the manager was polite, but did not offer to rectify the situation in any manner.\n\nI understand that all places have bad nights, but as I said, this has been a trend that we have noticed over the last year (maybe their expansion stressed the quality of service?), and we do not care to spend our hard-earned money at a place where we are ignored and apparently invisible every time we have gone there in the recent past; plus, their food is good, but not good enough to put up with sub-par service.  We'd much rather go to one of the restaurants in downtown Phoenix that has fantastic service and better food, which is what we did last night.",

Expect to sit alongside your mates and clip your bag to the bar as the place is truly tiny. Husband also got a light ale. \nRight away they wanted to take the order, but the menu is a fun adventure and as a first visit I really wanted to read all the selections. My family was starving so they just couldn't wait for me to meander over the varieties and the waitress was really eager to get moving. She said take your time, but she stood right there and so, I did feel a bit rushed. As a result I didn't order a side salad which I think would have made me happier.\nI was wondering if the Pasty was going to be enough, was it going to be soggy or burnt, was the crust going to be doughy or dry?  I mean I'm naturally a skeptical critic, why else would I Yelp? But my Pasty was perfect. It was not greasy, it was flaky but firm in the right parts, it wasn't burnt anywhere it was divine. My Pasty was not chock full of air pockets it was chock full of filling. My daughter could only eat half (she's 9) but the adults were perfectly satisfied without being bloated.\nI could bring my veggie friends/family here too.\nI knocked a star off because despite being not too busy we waited and waited to close out our check. She was too fast taking the order, and too slow to close us out. We didn't get to order any dessert because of our long wait with empty plates. Despite the unevenness of the service no one was rude or unpleasant and the pocket was so good we'll come back.  Next time I'm going to have the Reuben stuffed in there, my daughter wants to try the meatball and my husband just might have a Pilgrim (Thanksgiving in your hands! Lovely!) I know everyone can find a Pasty that they would like to eat here and I encourage you to go!\nUpdate: We did go back and have the above selections and I got a Chicken Tikka salad to share. Fabulous! I enjoyed the second visit even more. The Pilgrim is undeniably yum, the Reuben was chockfull of flavor, the meatball delighted my daughter but was so-so for me. The Indian spiced chicken was so tasty I wish they made it into a Pasty too. They do Lamb Vindaloo, so why not? I still recommend this place and will likely return a thrid time... so yummy.",

He had of great information he shared with us and was able to make us some great classic cocktails that we never knew could be done there and he did them wonderfully. Definitely want to come back when he's working and see what else he can make for us. \nIt's great to be in a place with such great quality and none of the attitude you get from some places that projects a high end image.

We then decided to share a side of \"chips\" (i.e. fries). The best part of sitting at any restaurant bar, is getting to see the workers do what they do. This place was even better for that idea since you could not only watch bartenders mixing up drinks, but the kitchen was front and center, so we were able to watch our food be made from start to finish!\n\nThe food took a bit to come out, but each order is made fresh and the fries are baked, not fried, so it's worth waiting for. Both our Pasties were delicious and very filling! The fries were cooked perfectly, and it was nice to step away from the fried food world and still enjoy a great stuffed pasty and fries.\n\nThe staff was very friendly and checked in on us regularly. We were so stuffed we didn't get dessert this go-round, however, it isn't out of the cards for the next visit!\n\nOverall: A\nA quirky \"hole-in-the-wall\" bar with amazing food, fun staff, and great ambiance.

I like that you can watch the food prep opera at the bar as they are continually putting together new pasties to keep up the supplies or, one of my new favorites, when the weather is nice, sit at the outside patio to enjoy the cool weather and the piped out music, which is audible but not overpowering.\n\nMy favorite pasties, which are a welsh savory pastry, are:\n\nThe Peppered Steak\nThe Greek (vegetarian)\n\nI'm also a big fan of their incredibly fresh house salads with pesto dressing - a regular is good enough for two people or half works for a single serving. I understand there are now locations in Mesa and Old Town Scottsdale but this was the original location and dare I say it, still my favorite. Worth checking out if you are looking for a place with good food and good beer, and people watching is always fun due to the location close to the University, it has a significant bohemian vibe and though I'm not a hipster (too old and too fat), it is fun to mingle with the more visible members of the creative class that Richard Florida writes about.",

Looks like the basement of a really old bar or maybe even a coal mine. Great place to gather up with the crew and down a few pints and then chow down on some tasty grub.\n\nTheir west side entrance has a long sit down bar with a few small tables and is rather cramped. The east side entrance has more of a full seating area with additional bar seating. Recommend using the east side one unless you are going undercover and need a quick escape.\n\nStarted with a cup of Cream of Leek, Potato & Stilton soup. It came with bread and butter and was very good. Ordered the Peppered Steak Pasty which is filled with Sirloin Steak, sautéed Portobello Mushrooms, Leeks, roasted Zucchini, and Stilton Bleu Cheese. It also came with a side of yummy Peppercorn Brandy Cream sauce.\n\nEverything was very satisfying. There are so many different versions of what they can make. Lamb, Chicken, Pork, Beef, and Veggie are just some of the fillings. I suppose you could make a check list and try them all. Hmmm?\n\nDon't forget some Dessert if you still have room.

The vibe is sort of hipster, but so relaxing.\n\nWill definitely be back!\n\n\nUPDATE: After coming in nearly every week for months, I've made a couple new observations. I really wish they would work on their customer service. There is only a couple of waitresses that actually do their job. The rest seem to disappear indefinitely. Food is still amazing and well drinks have good amount of liquor.",

In reality, NO ONE CARED about my attire, the lighting was dark and the seating was said to be from an old mine however it reminded me more of a church.  The people that work here are super chill, they were playing AC/DC's, \"Let there be Rock\" and the pasty's reminded me of an Australian pie. \n\nThe soup was fabulous and they give you tons of bread which is delicious to dip or butter! They've got pasties on pasties on pasties to pick from as well. I decided on the vegan eggplant parmesan and although I was under the impression I specifically asked for no cheese, vegan or not, I received it.

Don't let that put you off - the pasties are fantastic which is why it gets 5 starts from me! Extensive selection of vegetarian and even a few vegan choices, plus creative flavor combos. I've eaten many a Cornish pasty in my time, having frequented Cornwall quite a few times while growing up. These are really really good! The pastry is excellent and the fillings generous.

Some late times at Time Out led me talking to a lady who works there, who told me of the Vegan Pasty one calls 45 minutes ahead of time. At 2am, with some amber bock, oh man, I was STOKED. I woke up the next morning, counting DOWN THE HOURS till I could dial that number for the vegan goodie. She recognized my voice, and I didnt have internet, so she was sweet enough to list the ingredients-I ended up getting eggplant and a bunch of other veggies. \n\nMy companion picked me up, and its on the HARDY side of the University and Hardy, fyi. We walked into a long, kind of dark hallway with small two seaters on the right and a bar on the left. Dude...were we in the right place? This place was SLEEK-black and white decor, clean, hip, I mean, like URBAN chic man, but not pretentious. Since it wasn't too buzy, we did the two-seater and she took our beer order (yummy beer selection-we did miss the happy hour at 5pm, but the prices were still fine), and ran into some friends. \n\nThe real star of this story is really the Pasty-I learned I could add some Quorn (the best meat substitute EVA), but that was ok. My food with some sauce was amazingly comforting. Not overly spiced, not overly cooked, loved the taters in it, I mean, there was nothing wrong with it-NOTHING. Like a shephards pie, or a pot pie, or a calzone, who doesn't love a warm fold...? Yeah? Yeah? This is the bomb. AND even though I was starving, I could barely finish it, but I felt perfectly content aftewards and not overstuffed at all. \n\nI even have their sticker on my CELL PHONE to advertise my love for this place-yeah, you heard right.

Cornish Pasty is one of my favorite places to bring friends because not only is their food delicious and their service excellent, but their cozy atmosphere really helps make your dining experience feel so much more intimate! Plus, with all the different pasty fillings on their menu, there is literally something for everyone. Even my vegan friends! I love the fact that they always offer at least two vegan options every single day. Their pretty diverse beer/cider menu also make it a great spot to meet for just some drinks, although I can never stop by without getting a pasty!\nThe only reason I am giving them 4 stars is because you cannot alter the contents of a pasty filling unless you give them a call 24 hours in advance. Although it is nice that you have the option of calling ahead and customizing your meal, most of the time I go there on a whim and do not have this opportunity. Being unable to remove certain ingredients is a bit of a bummer, and although I understand why this is not possible (I believe they are all pre-stuffed in the morning?), it still makes me sad.",

The yogurt sauce was a nice calming flavor to counteract the spicy red curry. Usually you do not get a real curry kick when you go to a restaurant so be aware that this is the real thing. It's wonderfully spicy for those of you with a low tolerance just order something else. For those of you who adore curry and wanted an easy and tasty new way to eat it here in the U.S. this is for you.  I only say that because it's not the usual dish served up in the U.S. while pies and pasties have been the norm in the UK forever.  Big hit #1\n\nThe second was the Cottage Pie (shepherds=beef / cottage=lamb)  and this is so perfect. A nice mild lamb flavor with a wonderful cheesy, potato mix that is served with a red wine gravy. You get all the moisture without having a dripping mess on your hands. So perfectly cooked, and filling. If you want a great comfort food this is the one. Don't be fooled when you see it, this is one filling meal. I had trouble finishing although I couldn't keep from eating more than my stomach told me to. Loved it from start to finish.  \n\nThe crust is nice and golden brown, not to thick but more than enough to keep everything inside. It's so flaky and perfect I have no complaints and had to write a review.  The photo I took is showing the Cottage Pie... the Chicken Tikka is the other half you can't see the inside of. The sauce is the yogurt sauce for the Tikka as it was dark and was the better sauce to show up in my photo. \n\nGive it a try..it's worth stepping a few blocks out of the usually higher traveled old town area. This is worth getting up and driving out of the way for when you want a comfortable setting with plenty of outdoor seating, a huge bar with what looked like  a lot of beer choices. I loved the feel and the crowd it just had even with the smaller early week crowd. It was definitely bringing a bit of that Urban fun and people that Scottsdale needs. Just get there and enjoy.",

And I'm so glad we came! They were pretty busy at 8:30pm on a Saturday night. Walked in, sat ourselves, and a server showed up a couple minutes later to take our drink orders. I'd say they were a bit slow and not as attentive as I'd like but its more of a pub feel and they were pretty busy anyway. We ordered the Crispin hard ale to share and it was pretty tasty, not very sweet. I like how they have a large selection international beers (like King Fisher from India!) on their menu, its like you really are in an English pub!\n\nOur group got the Porky, Rosemary chicken, Lamb vindaloo, and chicken tikka masala pasties. We also ordered the broccoli and cauliflower bake and banana dessert. They were all good but I loved my lamb vindaloo, it was like actual lamb vindaloo that you would get at an Indian restaurant! Ironically the chicken tikka was my least favorite because it was too tomato-ey but it wasn't terrible. The yogurt sauce that came with complemented the pasty perfectly. \n\nThe broccoli cauliflower bake was delicious and cheesy, totally hit the spot on a cold night! The banoffe banana dessert was ok but I was disappointed that it was mostly whipped cream (unsweetened). The caramel, graham cracker crust and sliced bananas were still enough to carry on the dish. \n\nOverall great food, fun casual atmosphere ( saw LOTS of people on dates here) and totally worth checking out if you're in Tempe!",

I had the chicken tikka masala, which I expected to have more curry sauce but it was dry. The yogurt sauce complemented the pasty since it gave a cool taste to the dish. This pasty is worth a try if you are looking for something interesting.  My fiancee had the Oogie, which tasted dry and had scarce amount of steak chunks. If anything there were more potato chunks than steak chunks. The sauce that came with the Oogie did not taste good and made me want to throw up because it was a wine gravy sauce that tasted like expired sauce. I definitely do not recommend the Oogie.\n\nWarning: The pasty takes about 15 minutes to order, so do not come here hungry and expect to get your pasty right away. \n\nOverall, I do want to come back and give this place another try if I am ever in town.",

The restaurant is dim, moody and spacious with pool tables, a huge bar area and a misted patio. The vibe was very mellow on a weekday afternoon, but I can imagine it gets fairly busy on the weekends. After studying the extensive list of pastries (over two dozen), I went with the Carne Adovada from the premium list and the Cajun Chicken from the signature list and a side of the the broccoli cauliflower bake.\n\nThe broccoli cauliflower bake was delivered first. Think: healthy take on mac and cheese without giving up any of the flavor. The broccoli cauliflower dish was swimming in this wonderful cheese sauce and baked with tons of cheese on top creating a perfectly crisp exterior. Definitely delicious and a must order. \n\nThe pastries came next. Similar to a calzone but a lot less doughy, and a lot more flakey; the dough recipe is perfect because it is not overpowering to the savory delicious fillings. The Adovada was filled with simmered pork in New Mexican red chili stew, Mexican rice, hatch chilies and cheddar with a side of sour cream and salsa (the sides are switched in the photos). The pork was so tender and flavorful and the stew and chilies added a perfect kick. This was a British take on a Mexican influenced dish and it was a winner. The Cajun Chicken was filled with spicy cajun chicken breast, bacon, ham and Swiss and served with a side of chipotle sauce. The chicken was tender and the bacon added the right amount of smokiness paired with the chipotle sauce. I enjoyed this pastry as well, but the Adovada was the winner.\n\nWith so many options to choose from, you really can't go wrong here. I spend about fifteen minutes on the menu trying to decide which pasty to choose. There is something for everyone here with flavors ranging form Spanish influence, to Indian influence, to Mediterranean influence. The service was on point as well. We were directed to the main seating area by the host and the waitress took time to point out some of her favorites on the menu. She didn't seem to be very knowledgable on what each pasty included and the sauces were switched on my pastries, but all was forgiven after the first bite. There is a large private parking lot for the restaurant with free parking available. I'll be back next time I'm in town.",

The roasted garlic rosemary potatoes as a side dish were outstanding - very crunchy and well seasoned with of course Rosemary. Our pasties were equally impressive. The greek was my choice with big chunks of chicken, two kinds of cheese and veggies that included kalamata olives and artichokes. Every bite you got something new and it didn't even need both sauces, but the Tzitiki was excellent for dipping. dad had the Pilgrim (no turkey anymore), but had some nice roasted chicken and sweet poatoes and onions also. Thev wait staff was friendly as hell, great service and this place is bigger than it looks also on the inside. Good times.",

The service was terrible- they acted like we should have known to seat ourselves and weren't friendly or helpful, but doing the bare minimum assuming we'd been there before.\n\nI'd never had a pasty before, and I was not impressed.  I got the philly cheesesteak which the waiter informed was nothing like an actual philly cheesesteak.  As far as my experience goes, they include steak, cheese, mushrooms, peppers- all of which were also in the pasty.  The difference was, this steak was chewy and flavorless, I didn't taste any cheese, and there were more green peppers than any other ingredient.  The pastry part was good,  but undercooked.  \n\nI was excited that they had specific sauces to pair with each pasty.  The server allowed me to try both- a mustard one and a red wine one.  I found both to be gross and a terrible combination with the pasty. \n\nI just want to emphasize that I am not a picky eater and enjoy most food.  I was extremely disappointed that I spent money there.  Neither me nor my coworker finished our food and the waiter looked at us oddly when we didn't want to take the rest to go. No thanks. We were both totally confused by why people rave about this place.  Perhaps it is the good beer they serve...",

A slight step up from a hole in the wall type of place, this quaint spot serves up good, tasty, and satisfying food hot from the kitchen.\n\nWhat is a pasty?\n\nA pasty's history can be associated with the tin miners in England.  The story goes that these miners were covered head to toe in dust and other nasty stuff and would eat these calzone like dishes as a means to have nourishment without the need to return to the surface.  Supposedly, the miners were able to eat the pastry like food by holding onto the \"handles\" and when done, discard the tainted remains into the mine thereby appeasing the spirits that haunted the mines.\n\nAt the Cornish Pasty Co. I can first hand recommend the Chicken Pesto.  Very good flavoring and filling.  Or you can go with the more traditional route with beef, potatoes, and swede.  The sauces that come with your pasty are there to accent the flavors and are highly recommend to try as well.\n\nPros\n* Good food\n* Originality\n* Portions\n* Customer service\n* Coat hooks at the bar\n\nCons\n* Small interior",

I need to try everything on the menu, it's a plethora of flavor delights. The crust on each pasty is amazingly flaky and buttery and makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. The sauces are amazing. The food is last-meal-on-earth worthy.\n\nI cannot, however, give Cornish Pasty Co. five stars, because the service is sooo hit or miss. I will deal with slow service for the food, but good gravy I wish they'd get a clue on this point. Sometimes I go there and it's wonderful--I get my booze, food and check in a time frame reasonable for human living. Other times, I convince people I know to try the place out and we're literally there for two and a half hours while the one server working at the time roams the entire place and spends half the time chatting. \n\nI read a lot of yelp reviews of places I love and think people are being entitled jerks about the service and they should never leave corporate franchise places. I would never, never complain about service if it was even mediocre. Just, from time to time, the service here is so bad I do question whether I should ever go back.",

So I felt compelled to write a review about my experiences so that others would know this Cornish Pasty is in need of some management/owner love/help or something.... \n\nService~ yikes! It was turrible, to quote Charles Barkley.  Both visits were the same experience but with different servers.  The servers here seem more interested in talking with each other rather than serving their customers.  On both visits we had to remind our server multiple times to refill our drinks and bring us condiments.  Probably the biggest disappointment is when we complained about our food.  They both were very disinterested in turning our poor dining experience into a positive one.  When we asked to speak to someone in charge in our 2nd turrible visit the waitress disappeared!  I kid you not!  She never came back and when we asked the bartender about her she stated that she went on a break....\n\nFood~ prior visits we've had a pretty good experience trying the different pasty's however lately their food has not been up to par!  The pasty's are very dry lately for some reason and they lack flavor.  This last visit we had the bangers and mash, chicken and the traditional beef and potatoes.  We also had a couple of side of fries and some salads.  The salads and fries were the best parts of our dining experience again unfortunately.  The banger and mash was ok.  It had a good balance of bangers to mash but had too much onions.  Since when did onions become a major star in this pasty?  The chicken pasty was not filled completely and was very dry.  The waitress suggested the red wine sauce to help?? WTH?  NO THE RED WINE SAUCE DOES NOT GO WELL WITH ALL PASTY'S, ESPECIALLY THEIR CHICKEN PASTY! It was gross!  We asked for a different sauce.   The waitress stated that was their only sauce but she could bring us ketchup and that's what a lot of people use.  Yes she did say that! If a lot of people are requesting ketchup, the cook, heck the owner needs to know their customers are having to douse their pasty's in ketchup because they are too dry.  The beef and potato pasty was more potato than beef and yes it was arid dry as the desert....\n\nSo for both visits I give this Cornish Pasty 2 stars because of their salad and fries.  For had we not order those this would easily be a 1 star review. I hope they can turn this place around soon!",

            "text": "Ok, I was at Lawrence Dunham Vineyards across the street for their grand opening and someone said you have to try the Cornish Pasty Company across the street. Being a big fan of Pasties and Shepherd/Cottage pie.. we gave it a try. The starter we ordered was some Vindaloo (I believe) hot wings. They were perfectly charred and still moist inside with a nice spicy kick.  \n\nThe main entree's we split were the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Cottage Pie. WOW! What a lovely treat when the mains came out. The Chickent Tikka Masala was quite spicy and moist without having so much juice that it made a huge mess. The yogurt sauce was a nice calming flavor to counteract the spicy red curry. Usually you do not get a real curry kick when you go to a restaurant so be aware that this is the real thing. It's wonderfully spicy for those of you with a low tolerance just order something else. For those of you who adore curry and wanted an easy and tasty new way to eat it here in the U.S. this is for you.  I only say that because it's not the usual dish served up in the U.S. while pies and pasties have been the norm in the UK forever.  Big hit #1\n\nThe second was the Cottage Pie (shepherds=beef / cottage=lamb)  and this is so perfect. A nice mild lamb flavor with a wonderful cheesy, potato mix that is served with a red wine gravy. You get all the moisture without having a dripping mess on your hands. So perfectly cooked, and filling. If you want a great comfort food this is the one. Don't be fooled when you see it, this is one filling meal. I had trouble finishing although I couldn't keep from eating more than my stomach told me to. Loved it from start to finish.  \n\nThe crust is nice and golden brown, not to thick but more than enough to keep everything inside. It's so flaky and perfect I have no complaints and had to write a review.  The photo I took is showing the Cottage Pie... the Chicken Tikka is the other half you can't see the inside of. The sauce is the yogurt sauce for the Tikka as it was dark and was the better sauce to show up in my photo. \n\nGive it a try..it's worth stepping a few blocks out of the usually higher traveled old town area. This is worth getting up and driving out of the way for when you want a comfortable setting with plenty of outdoor seating, a huge bar with what looked like  a lot of beer choices. I loved the feel and the crowd it just had even with the smaller early week crowd. It was definitely bringing a bit of that Urban fun and people that Scottsdale needs. Just get there and enjoy.",

Some of the more traditional stuff is $7 to $7.50, while everything else is $8-9.  Beer is also a little on the pricey side (20 ounce drafts are $5-6) for this kind of place.

I would have never considered this place (because of its location and I had never heard about it before) if it weren't for my fiance who had read a review and decided that we should give it a try.  To my amazement, this place is actually very cool!  I can't think of another place like it anywhere.  I have tried about 4 or 5 of their pasties and they have all been excellent.  I can only describe them as \"calzones filled with awesomeness\".  There has to be at least 15 different ones to choose from and they are all probably very tasty.  I cannot vouch for how healthy the things are, but they are very good.  At about 7ish dollars for a pasty they are a good value because they fill you up quite nicely.\n\nWith my meal, I usually get a salad (their dressing is amazing), the mashed peas and the roasted potatoes.  Sometimes I can't help but have one (or more) of their $3 Irish car bombs.  The salad, peas and potatoes are enough to share with 2-3 people, but keep the car bombs for yourself!\n\nMy only complaint about this place is the seating.  If you have a party of 3 or more you just shouldn't go there.  Not only is the place tiny, the tables are only for 2 people.  I think they only have 1 or 2 tables that can accommodate more.  There is a bar area and that is where I dine because the tables are usually filled.\n\nOur new thing is to pre-order a few pasties.  They have them ready in just a few minutes, you pick them up, then pop them in your own oven.  This way we don't have to worry about seating.  \n\nAlso, the service there is always friendly and fast, but always a bit frenzied because the place is always so busy.",

This is the perfect place to take your vegetarian friend even if you love meat because their are so many options for both. \n\nThe only thing I can compare this to for those who haven't tried it is a more delicate calzone without the excess cheese, if you like calzones you will love Cornish Pasty.

I admit, I was skeptical, I'm not a huge 'bread' or 'carb' fan, and I really don't like thick bread coated anything.  The pasties I've had in the past were similar to calzones in breadiness.  The pasties here, were something amazing and not at all what I've had in the past or imagined.  There menu was quite complete with heavier choices such as the meat and cheese to lighter chicken options and even some dessert pasties.  I opted for a chicken tikka masala pasty.  I was impressed by the presentation, a simple metal plate with the well portioned pasty cut in half and a side of tsaziki sauce.  The pasty crust was thin and delicate.  It was reminiscent of a hand worked Christmas pie dough that your Grandmother slaved over.  It wasn't too flaky or thick, and was the perfect match for the tasty filling.  The filling was delicious chunks of white meat chicken, little nibbles of potatoes and some peas in a deliciously balanced flavorful masala sauce.  The taste was quite authentic and the spice right on par with what I'd expect from an Indian food restaurant.  The tsaziki side sauce was cool and tangy, it was a good flavor contrast to the spicy meat pocket.  Since the  portion was rather large, I had more than half of my pasty left and took it to go.  I couldn't resist trying the PB&J pasty though.  I had one warmed and packaged to go.  I am SO glad I got the PB&J pasty as well.  It was so incredibly delicious!  Served with a side of fresh whipped cream, the PB&J was like an old childhood friend.  The warm crunchy peanut butter with the perfect banana slice and sweet strawberry jelly melted harmoniously in my mouth and still gave that satisfying 'coat your mouth' feeling that peanut butter does.  I will definitely return.",

It was kind of weird at first to have a conversation, but you get comfortable!\n\nWe decided to order 2 and share, so we could try more variety. We got a meat and cheese, which was served with a red wine sauce. Maybe because I am not a fan of red wine I didn't like the sauce!?!? But the pastry was so tasty! The meat was very flavorful and the cheese was gooey and yummy! \n\nWe also ordered the Lamb Vindaloo, wow was this spicy! Don't get me wrong I can handle spice! And I would say any more and it would be too much. The Sauce that came with it was necessary to cool off your mouth, and it helped that it was very tasty and refreshing! \n\nI am looking forward to going back and trying the many different pastries they have.\n\nBut please don't let me forget to mention dessert aka creamy heavenly goodness, that is the peanut butter and jelly pastry.

Luckily, it's near the Airport, so it makes a great place to have your first and/or last meal on a trip to Phoenix.\n\nPasties are tasty meat or vegetable pies meant to be lowered to hungry miners in Cornwall. Fortunately for us, someone thought of  bringing them to the US, and particularly to the Phoenix area. I had the Lamb Vindaloo (probably not an import from Cornwall), and my brother had the Balsamic Portabello. Both were delicious; the Vindaloo was spicy, but not too spicy. Go ahead and order it - you won't be sorry.  Since this was sort of dinner, we then shared the Pilgrim, which incorporated turkey, sweet potatoes, stuffing and a side of cranberry sauce. This was OK, but could have used more turkey, and less stuffing. Pies ranged from $6.50-9.00.\n\nExcellent selection of European draft beers in 14, 20, and 34 ounce mugs, the largest being a mere $8-9 bucks. Also many imported premium bottles, plus Tempe's own Four Peaks Kilt Lifter (6%) for only $3.50. What a deal.\n\nFor other New Yorkers reading this, I understand Myers of Keswick, a shop on Hudson Street, has Cornish Pasties and other meat pies. They're generally less than $4.00, so probably smaller and for takeout only. I'll give you an update on this next time I'm down in the Village.",

            "text": "Let me first start off by saying that I love Cornish Pasty. So why the three star review? Well, their food is great, but the service is lousy. But let me back up a bit.\n\nThe very first time someone told me about \"The Pasty,\" as I refer to it, they described a pasty as \"a gourmet hot pocket.\" Let me tell you, that did not sound appealing. Despite how great they tried to make it sound, I could not get over the idea of a gourmet hot pocket. So I never checked it out until maybe a year ago when I was recommended by another friend, and figured I'd just give it a shot. It was delightful!\n\nI've since been to The Pasty multiple times. It's the food that keeps me coming back. \"The Pilgrim\" is like Thanksgiving! I get it almost every time. It's a combination of turkey, sweet potatoes, onions, mushrooms, and other wonderful flavors inside. Served with a side of cranberry sauce and a red wine gravy. I'm not too crazy about the gravy, but the cranberry sauce is awesome. I've also tried their Greek salad and black bean soup, which are just as wonderful. I love the bread that comes with the soup, and the dressing on the salad.\n\nAlthough this location is closer to my house, I prefer going to the one on Guadalupe and Dobson because the service is slightly better (although both locations have poor service). And this location on University is way too dark and full of hipsters. But, I guess people dig that nowadays.\n\nThe main reason I'm writing this review is because of a trip I made to this location yesterday. I went with my boyfriend and we split all three items mentioned above. The Greek salad, black bean soup, and The Pilgrim. I was starving and was hoping our server would bring the soup and salad out first. I was thrilled when she came back after a couple minutes with the soup and was hoping the salad would come out shortly after. I love bread and when we ran out of bread (meaning after I scarfed all the bread down), I patiently waited for our server to come back around so I could ask for more bread, as well as the status on our salad. Remember when I said I was starving? Well, I start to get a little cranky when I'm hungry, and our server was not making any rounds to see how her tables were doing. After fifteen or so minutes, I decide to go over to where our server is talking with another server, and ask for more bread, nicely of course. Once she comes back with our bread, the soup is cold, but I don't really mind. I was just happy she put more bread in front of me. A few minutes later our pasty comes out. She had obviously forgotten about our salad (guess that's what happens when you don't write anything down) so I reminded her and she comes back shortly with it. Only after we had been sitting there for ten minutes after we had finished everything and the busser, who was much friendly than our server, had already cleared the table, did our server appear from the darkness and we were finally able to get our check, pay, and leave. I'm used to the service being not so great, but this was just awful.\n\nI thought maybe if I wrote a review about my last experience, they'd change the service up or hire better servers. Serving itself isn't very hard, I know, I've done it. And it doesn't take much effort to check up on a table. But the people who work at The Pasty just don't seem to care about anything. I guess that's just a hipster thing. (I would love to see their interview process, if there even is one. \"Do you know how to carry food?\" \"Yes.\" \"Okay, you're hired.\")\n\nAnyway, I think I will be driving out of the way to go to the other Pasty instead. Since their servers are a little more attentive and I can actually see who I'm eating with, and what I'm eating for that matter. Hah, I can only imagine what that place looks like in the light. Maybe they keep it dark for a reason.\n\nIt's not like I'm expecting five star service or anything, I get that it's a bar too. But come on.

We had checked out the website and menu, so knew what we wanted to try.  \nFirst thing, in a lot of pictures, the place looks really cramped and small...wrong!   When you first walk in, there's a narrow hallway with a bar on one side and small 2-seat tables on the other.  But, if you walk around the corner, it opens up into a pretty large dining room (there's also a bar in here), as well as a nice sized patio.\nWe seated ourselves, and were immediately met by Hannah, our server.  She was friendly and made us feel welcome.  We perused the menu, but we both pretty much knew what we wanted.  \nI ordered \"The Pilgrim\" and my hubby ordered \"The Reuben\".  While we waited for our pasty's, we were able to enjoy the music playing.  Lots of our favorites, so the wait didn't seem like too long.  \n\"The Reuben\" is basically exactly what it sounds like...a reuben sandwich in a flaky wrap.  It was served with a side of 1000 island dressing.  My husband loved it, before I had a chance to ask for a bite...it was gone!!\n\"The Pilgrim\" is like a Thanksgiving dinner in a pasty.  It had roast chicken (during the holidays they serve it with roast turkey, but honestly, I couldn't tell the difference), sweet potatoes, stuffing and grilled onions.  It was served with a side of cranberry sauce.  OMG!!!  It was delicious and moist.  The chicken was so juicy.   Each bite reminded me of the day after Thanksgiving sandwiches...only this wasn't leftovers.  I devoured it!  My husband, who doesn't like stuffing, kept saying that when we go back, he's gonna order it.  Delicious!!!\nThe flakiness and flavor of the dough is wonderful.  Honestly, it's so moist and flavorful, you don't even need a sauce or condiment.  Most of the meals come with a red wine gravy on the side (and so did mine), but it definitely wasn't needed.  If I had ordered something with beef, it might have been a nice sauce to dunk a bite into, but like I said, it may not even be needed.\nWe're definitely going to make our way back to Tempe for another taste of a pasty, and there are a lot of very interesting ones on the menu.  We can't wait to try more!",

He made it a point to visit this place every time he came into town, and he felt strongly that I should do the same. Now that I'm actually living in town, I made this happen. And I must say, I'm sad it took me this long to get there, because I've been missing out!\n\nFirst off, a pasty is a wonderful, flaky pocket of deliciousness. It's like the best pot pie crust wrapped completely around a variety of different combinations. The crust alone is fantastic, and when you put those fillings in it, I couldn't get enough.\n\nWhen I walked into this place, I kind of wondered where I had gotten myself. The Tempe location is nearly pitch black inside. On a positive note, it's a nice place to go in the middle of the hot summer here, because it was nice and cool inside. There's also a nice porch to eat outside if the weather permits. Seating is on a \"help yourself\" basis, and I think this may lend itself towards the servers not necessarily noticing you immediately. That's what happened to us, both at the beginning and the end of our meal.\n\nI had the Pilgrim pasty, which is essentially a Thanksgiving meal all wrapped inside a pastyl. It has turkey, grilled onions, sweet potatoes, chicken, and stuffing, and is served with a red wine gravy and cranberry sauce. I'm a sucker for cranberry sauce and for Thanksgiving in general, and this totally hit the spot! Normally I'd have been in a bit of a spot trying to decide among the various delicious-sounding options, but when I saw this one, I knew I had to have it. One of my friends had the Meat and Cheese pasty, and it was solid as well.\n\nI just looked at the menu again as I was writing this, and my mouth is watering now. There are so many other great selections, and I'm eager to get back and try more.\n\nIn summary, great food and unique atmosphere, but don't be in a rush, because the service isn't all that speedy.",

Being a big fan of Pasties and Shepherd/Cottage pie.. we gave it a try. The starter we ordered was some Vindaloo (I believe) hot wings. They were perfectly charred and still moist inside with a nice spicy kick.  \n\nThe main entree's we split were the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Cottage Pie. WOW! What a lovely treat when the mains came out. The Chickent Tikka Masala was quite spicy and moist without having so much juice that it made a huge mess. The yogurt sauce was a nice calming flavor to counteract the spicy red curry. Usually you do not get a real curry kick when you go to a restaurant so be aware that this is the real thing. It's wonderfully spicy for those of you with a low tolerance just order something else. For those of you who adore curry and wanted an easy and tasty new way to eat it here in the U.S. this is for you.  I only say that because it's not the usual dish served up in the U.S. while pies and pasties have been the norm in the UK forever.  Big hit #1\n\nThe second was the Cottage Pie (shepherds=beef / cottage=lamb)  and this is so perfect. A nice mild lamb flavor with a wonderful cheesy, potato mix that is served with a red wine gravy. You get all the moisture without having a dripping mess on your hands. So perfectly cooked, and filling. If you want a great comfort food this is the one. Don't be fooled when you see it, this is one filling meal. I had trouble finishing although I couldn't keep from eating more than my stomach told me to. Loved it from start to finish.  \n\nThe crust is nice and golden brown, not to thick but more than enough to keep everything inside. It's so flaky and perfect I have no complaints and had to write a review.  The photo I took is showing the Cottage Pie... the Chicken Tikka is the other half you can't see the inside of. The sauce is the yogurt sauce for the Tikka as it was dark and was the better sauce to show up in my photo. \n\nGive it a try..it's worth stepping a few blocks out of the usually higher traveled old town area. This is worth getting up and driving out of the way for when you want a comfortable setting with plenty of outdoor seating, a huge bar with what looked like  a lot of beer choices. I loved the feel and the crowd it just had even with the smaller early week crowd. It was definitely bringing a bit of that Urban fun and people that Scottsdale needs. Just get there and enjoy.",

I was looking for a place to grab some good food and a couple beers before a concert so I checked out Yelp and it did not lead me astray.\n\nTo me, a place like this is why Yelp needs to exist.  It was not in the most obvious location and when the group I was with went to walk in the front door we almost didn't know we were in the right place.  Let's just say their limited space is used very efficiently.  For what this place lacks in size, it makes up in character.\n\nInside it was kind of dark with some chairs lining the bar long the open kitchen and on the other wall a few small tables.  We found our spot in the back which was probably the only table big enough for 6 people.  The place was full and the noise level was just right; busy, but comfortable to have some lively dinner conversation. (Especially after some Irish Car Bombs.)\n\nTheir draft beer selection stuck to the UK theme with a lot of beers from that region.  I was especially surprised to see some Strongbow Cider.  They also had a few good micro brews from places like Firestone and Rogue.  Between that selection and the 32 oz. monster glasses they'd serve it in, this place was already a winner.\n\nMost importantly, their food was excellent.  I had the TIki Masala pasty and my wife had the Chicken Greek.  The Tiki Masala would be a great dish served by itself in an Indian restaurant.  Put it in a pasty and it's game over.  I tasted my wife's Chicken Greek which I probably wouldn't have picked as one of my own top choices to order and it was awesome.\n\nWe unanimously agreed this place was great and we had a laugh about some review around here that compared it to a Hot Pocket.  LOL.  I'll have to save that one under, \"Knowing about good food - FAIL!\"",

            "text": "Who doesn't like pastries??? And savory pastries, much less. An 'Oggie', is the classic pasty that is still savored in Cornwall and all over the UK today. After hearing so many locals rave about the famous pastry, I had to pay the Cornish Pastry Company a visit. Talk about a British pub. This place mimics the dark, mysterious alley pubs in England. The restaurant is dim, moody and spacious with pool tables, a huge bar area and a misted patio. The vibe was very mellow on a weekday afternoon, but I can imagine it gets fairly busy on the weekends. After studying the extensive list of pastries (over two dozen), I went with the Carne Adovada from the premium list and the Cajun Chicken from the signature list and a side of the the broccoli cauliflower bake.\n\nThe broccoli cauliflower bake was delivered first. Think: healthy take on mac and cheese without giving up any of the flavor. The broccoli cauliflower dish was swimming in this wonderful cheese sauce and baked with tons of cheese on top creating a perfectly crisp exterior. Definitely delicious and a must order. \n\nThe pastries came next. Similar to a calzone but a lot less doughy, and a lot more flakey; the dough recipe is perfect because it is not overpowering to the savory delicious fillings. The Adovada was filled with simmered pork in New Mexican red chili stew, Mexican rice, hatch chilies and cheddar with a side of sour cream and salsa (the sides are switched in the photos). The pork was so tender and flavorful and the stew and chilies added a perfect kick. This was a British take on a Mexican influenced dish and it was a winner. The Cajun Chicken was filled with spicy cajun chicken breast, bacon, ham and Swiss and served with a side of chipotle sauce. The chicken was tender and the bacon added the right amount of smokiness paired with the chipotle sauce. I enjoyed this pastry as well, but the Adovada was the winner.\n\nWith so many options to choose from, you really can't go wrong here. I spend about fifteen minutes on the menu trying to decide which pasty to choose. There is something for everyone here with flavors ranging form Spanish influence, to Indian influence, to Mediterranean influence. The service was on point as well. We were directed to the main seating area by the host and the waitress took time to point out some of her favorites on the menu. She didn't seem to be very knowledgable on what each pasty included and the sauces were switched on my pastries, but all was forgiven after the first bite. There is a large private parking lot for the restaurant with free parking available. I'll be back next time I'm in town.",

At the end of the 3rd day, I had seen enough food to feed the LSU National champion football team.  I could out fast Les or Bear on their survivor shows\n\nDinner time was approaching.....My business associate and I couldn't face a full course dinner for at least another 24 hours...but we knew we had to eat something so we wouldnt wake up at 3 am famished.  I remembers reading about this place in Yelp that would be perfect for our situation....so remembering some favorable Yelp reviews in Phoenix  I said to him:\n\n\"How about pastys for dinner?\"\n\nHe went from a relaxed and carefree disposition to a stunned and shocked demeanor.   He looked me like I was from another planet and his glance indicated doubt about my integrity.   Then with a delayed but dry smile he spoke up and said....\n\n\"Aren't those things they wear at the.....\"\n\n\"NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!    Not pasties......pastys.\"   I retorted quickly before the people in the lobby heard the next nouns he was just about to utter.   \"Pasty's with a short vowel, not long.   Have you ever had one.?\"\n\nStill thinking of the long vowel version, he hesitated a little and answered with a \"No\" veiled with a lot of doubt and concern.\n\n\"Good.   That's where we're going.\"    As I glanced over to him, I could see a sense of curiousity, dispair and expectation of upcoming chaos.\n\nWe arrived at 7:45 pm.   It's dark everywhere.   In the street, in the parking lot.   We enter the restaurant and it's no brighter.   \n\nIt is a very narrow and long restaurant with just enough room for seats at the bar nearly the length of the store and small side tables on the side.  The interior decoration theme is obvious here.   Build the biggest bar that would fit in this row house type of store, and accessorize the rest of the restaurant around the bar.  \n\nSitting in a very dark restaurant, with Beatle music blaring away, this English pub type of place had a huge variety of pastys....from traditional steak and potatoes, to bangers and mash, to more contempory selections that include vegetarian, curries, and fish.   They have a huge selection of international beers, many of which are of the UK......duhhh.\n\nI wanted to eat \"light\" so I selected the Lovely Bit a Salmon which is\nAtlantic Salmon in a white wine cream & dill sauce, sauted asparagus, spinach, roasted red potatoes, spinach and roasted tomatoes. \n\nWHAT A GREAT DISH.   Everything was layered carefully inside the pasty which was served cut in half.  The salmon was cooked perfectly.  The asparagus was not over cooked but had a crunch.   All the flavors blended well together.   I still wasn't hungry so I took one half of it back to the hotel....and had it for breakfast the following morning......which tasted just great.\n\nMy buddy had Spicy Asiago Chicken which was spicy chicken, roasted corn, black beans, asiago cheese, hatch chilies, and Mexican stewed tomatoes with a side of sour cream & salsa.   That too was excellent.\n\nIf ever in Phoenix, this would be worth any drive to have lunch or dinner and a beer.\n\nAfter dinner I asked him if he would return to eat here and he said he readily would.    Then I detected a slight pause and a curl of a smile in the background.........maybe he was fantasizing buying a long vowel...",

Their Lamb vidaloo, Chicken tikka masala brings out the complete flavor in a pasty form. The filling is delicious and their pasty, so soft made of complete butter just melts in the mouth, baked till crisp golden from the outside . One can eat just the plain pasty and crave for more.

Uhh the hell do I want to cover up my nipples for I asked.  But noooo, these are like other reviewers have said, fancy hot pockets or giant dumpling...!\nI feel like everything at night in AZ is dark cause your windows are blacked out.  It gives a strange sensation at night...maybe it's just me.  But this place was pretty dark outside.  \nGreeted immediately upon entering...always a great first impression.  The interior was dark but decently lit.  Seating was primarily either the bar or long communal tables w/ benches.\nThey play some cool metal/alt music that must be local or unsigned cause shazam wouldn't even pick that up.\nI went straight for the \"Premium\" section and got a Tandoori Chicken Pasty.  So the pasty itself is cut in half but it's a little difficult to eat like a hot pocket since it does fall apart, so you're better off with utensils.  But I'm a savage so I eat with my hands...take that pasty.\nDon't forget the fries!  Garlic!  With Jalapenos!  Fresh cut, some skin, and nice and crispy!",

I definately wasnt disappointed. I ordered the cajun chicken and booooy was it bomb. Its a great size and fills you up without making you over the top full. There are so many pasty selections it was almost hard to chose. \nMusic was on point and so was the service. Only complaint is that you would expect your pasty to come out much quicker than it had, thinking they just bake it for you but Im just being picky. \nWould 100% recommend checking out this hole in the wall spot, not to mention im pretty sure I had an arabian goddess as a server who made the experience that much more fun. Great staff. Its a very hipster spot which only made me feel more at home. Check out Cornish pasty! You wont be dissappointed.",

It's in an odd location at a strip-mall that's tucked around the corner from a decent Mexican restaurant and a sub-shop.  \n\nI'm not sure if they're going for the feel of a mineshaft, but it was ridiculously cold in there.  I'm all for beating the heat, but to go from 104 to 62 degrees was a little much for me.  \n\nI could talk more about the ambiance, which is mildly interesting, but the food is the most important thing.  I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala (Red curry) which had chicken, potato, and the red curry sauce.  The chicken was dry, as well as the curry sauce.  Mere days before I'd had Chicken red curry at George and Dragon in Phoenix, which was really good.  The pasty was not on par with that.  I have to say it was one of the more bland curries I've ever had.  Perhaps I should have tried something like their Bangers and Mash or Shepherd's Pie.\n\nAs for the price, everything on the menu should cost about 20% less.  I think Cornish Pasty is WAY overpriced.  Some of the more traditional stuff is $7 to $7.50, while everything else is $8-9.  Beer is also a little on the pricey side (20 ounce drafts are $5-6) for this kind of place.  Two Boddington's and a pasty were $18 before tax and tip.  So if you absolutely have to have a pasty then I guess this is your place, otherwise there are some other fabulous places nearby that won't break the bank.",

My wife is a pasty expert since her mother (who has made pasty's all her life) comes from Ontonagon, in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, which is knows as pasty country. We both tried the \"original\" pasty which we both agreed it was true to the original. It was hot, and full of the expected ingredients. In addition to the original the have many other types of pasty's, from Greek, to Mexican, vegetarian, chicken, salmon, to name a few. We would have liked to try some other styles of pasty, and will do so on our next visit to the Tempe area.  In addition to the pasty I did try a cup of one of the soups. The Cream of Leek, Potato and Stilton soup was to die for. A bowl of this soup could have been a meal in itself. Beer choices were very good, and they do have a happy hour 3-6 and all day Sunday with $1 off all beers.",

Luckily, it's near the Airport, so it makes a great place to have your first and/or last meal on a trip to Phoenix.\n\nPasties are tasty meat or vegetable pies meant to be lowered to hungry miners in Cornwall. Fortunately for us, someone thought of  bringing them to the US, and particularly to the Phoenix area. I had the Lamb Vindaloo (probably not an import from Cornwall), and my brother had the Balsamic Portabello. Both were delicious; the Vindaloo was spicy, but not too spicy. Go ahead and order it - you won't be sorry.  Since this was sort of dinner, we then shared the Pilgrim, which incorporated turkey, sweet potatoes, stuffing and a side of cranberry sauce. This was OK, but could have used more turkey, and less stuffing. Pies ranged from $6.50-9.00.\n\nExcellent selection of European draft beers in 14, 20, and 34 ounce mugs, the largest being a mere $8-9 bucks. Also many imported premium bottles, plus Tempe's own Four Peaks Kilt Lifter (6%) for only $3.50.

Their menu is large and diverse and can please anyone! My favorite part is the vegetarian options that are amazing, even if you are not vegetarian. I have gone probably 5-10 times and every time try something new and love it. I have looked for places that sell Cornish Pasties in other locations over the U.S. although have not been successful.

My favorite among the savory pasties is the cottage pie pasty. Well, is it even possible to go wrong with seasoned ground beef, mashed potatoes, cheddar cheese, carrots and peas all stuffed into a buttery, flaky pie? I think not.\n\nThe chicken tikka masala pasty contains diced potatoes and green peppers (not what you'd expect in chicken tikka masala) along with curried chicken. \n\nThe sweet pasties are great, but they are a rather large portion for dessert. The sticky toffee pudding is some of the best I've ever had. \n\nThe interior of the restaurant is very dark. Not sure what kind of effect the owners were going for, but whatever it was, it was completely lost on me. \n\nThe Cornish Pasty Company started in the Phoenix area, and has expanded into cities like Las Vegas and Boston.

Being a big fan of Pasties and Shepherd/Cottage pie.. we gave it a try. The starter we ordered was some Vindaloo (I believe) hot wings. They were perfectly charred and still moist inside with a nice spicy kick.  \n\nThe main entree's we split were the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Cottage Pie. WOW! What a lovely treat when the mains came out. The Chickent Tikka Masala was quite spicy and moist without having so much juice that it made a huge mess. The yogurt sauce was a nice calming flavor to counteract the spicy red curry. Usually you do not get a real curry kick when you go to a restaurant so be aware that this is the real thing. It's wonderfully spicy for those of you with a low tolerance just order something else. For those of you who adore curry and wanted an easy and tasty new way to eat it here in the U.S. this is for you.  I only say that because it's not the usual dish served up in the U.S. while pies and pasties have been the norm in the UK forever.  Big hit #1\n\nThe second was the Cottage Pie (shepherds=beef / cottage=lamb)  and this is so perfect. A nice mild lamb flavor with a wonderful cheesy, potato mix that is served with a red wine gravy. You get all the moisture without having a dripping mess on your hands. So perfectly cooked, and filling. If you want a great comfort food this is the one. Don't be fooled when you see it, this is one filling meal. I had trouble finishing although I couldn't keep from eating more than my stomach told me to. Loved it from start to finish.  \n\nThe crust is nice and golden brown, not to thick but more than enough to keep everything inside. It's so flaky and perfect I have no complaints and had to write a review.  The photo I took is showing the Cottage Pie... the Chicken Tikka is the other half you can't see the inside of. The sauce is the yogurt sauce for the Tikka as it was dark and was the better sauce to show up in my photo. \n\nGive it a try..it's worth stepping a few blocks out of the usually higher traveled old town area. This is worth getting up and driving out of the way for when you want a comfortable setting with plenty of outdoor seating, a huge bar with what looked like  a lot of beer choices. I loved the feel and the crowd it just had even with the smaller early week crowd. It was definitely bringing a bit of that Urban fun and people that Scottsdale needs. Just get there and enjoy.",

The Tempe location is tucked in the corner of a dingy mall far out of the Mill Ave nightlife.  There is barely a sign on the building, the windows are painted dark black with an old photo mural theme, the door leads into a narrow black corridor with no greeter.  It looks like a bar with a few 2-person tables and that's all ... until you accidentally discover that the bar (with barstools) is actually a \"kitchen\" with no alcohol and that if you wend your way around the end of the bar, passing the restrooms, you will find the actual dining room and drinking bar.  We ate in the kitchen/bar and only later happened upon that discovery and that there is second equally dark and foreboding door that goes to the main dining room.\n\nThe employees seemed to all guys, with a distinct aura of all being bikers, but they were super-friendly and acceptably attentive.  Assuming the food is made from scratch, the 20 - 30 minute wait to be served was also acceptable.  You can pass the time enjoying an excellent selection of draft and bottled beers.\n\nAt $6.50, my Oggie pasty was a good value.  The crust was tender and flakey and the meat was tasty.  I learned from this my first experience with rutabaga that I am not a fan of rutabaga, but that's not their fault. The amount of filling was roughly what you get in one of those tiny 99 cent pot pies in the frozen food section of the supermarket.  The brown-wine gravy was yummy.\n\nThe place sends a confusing message. It absolutely looks like a college dive (and I probably would be there all the time if I attended ASU) but it's quite a hike from campus. It's not Scottsdale funky (yea!!), and if you are wearing anything fancier than a tee shirt and jeans you would definitely feel out of place.  It's a curiously quiet place, none of the ribaldry you would find at an Irish pub (the canned music was mostly soft rock of the 70's and 80's).\n\nBottom line - it's rare to find a good pasty in this area, and these are good.  As the rating states, it's A-OK.",

            "text": "It has been a LONG TIME since I have been to this place, but I would love to put my 10 cents in.  First off, before eating here I didn't even know meat pies existed.  It was like an awesome burrito but with a flaky crust and WAY more choices.  When I lived in Tempe I was a terribly picky eater and every single time I came in I got the same thing, the meatball pasty.  It was awesome, everytime.  Everything on the menu looks delicious and it looks like the flavors blend together very well.  They are premade before you get there, so you cant really have them take ingredients out, although I am sure if you let them know ahead of time it can be arranged.\n\nSo there are 2 things I would like to talk about here.  First, the atmosphere.  Walking in you have a tiny restaurant that has a bar on one side and some small tables against the wall.  All the waiters are tatted up and lend an air of ruggedness to the joint.  As you sit at the bar, they are right in front of you rolling up the pasties and behind them are the stoves that they bake your pies in after you order them.  So basically you are sitting at a bar, drinking a cold beer and you can feel the heat from the ovens.  In some places this would be annoying, but again I feel like it lends greatness to the atmosphere.  The music is usually some good British rock and once again, yes, lends to the atmosphere.  So I enjoy feeling like I am in some tiny pub in Cornwall.\n\nSecond, THE DESSERT!  I will start with the Strawberry Pavlova which I could have done without.  The meringue shell is light and unless that is your cup of tea, keep on reading.  The PB&J pasty I only had one time and it was good, but second rate for me compared to the next two items.  Next up is the caramel apple pasty.  Delish!  Apple and caramel baked into the pie shell and topped with ice cream.  However nothing in this world can touch the BANOFFEE Pie!  Dig this real quick, a thick graham cracker pie crust.  Top that with caramel.  Top that with whipped cream and top that with bananas.  Oh, and if you are crazy ask them for strawberries too...and ice cream.  Now eat that and tell me you've had a better dessert.  I sure as hell havent!",

I always bring friends and family visiting here to try the unique cuisine. I like to explain it as 'gourmet hot pockets'. I haven't ordered a thing I didn't like. I know it can be hard for picky eaters since there are no substitutions but thankfully I don't have that problem. Their soups are amazing, all made in house. The peppered steak and chicken and rice soup are my two favorite dishes. The Mesa location recently added some new appetizers and I can't wait to try them all. Very disappointed to find that Tempe didn't add them to the menu yet. \n\nThe atmosphere, music, and excellent drink selection is another aspect I love about this place.

Last time I ate at the mesa location the service had improved a lot, unfortunately I went to Tempe a week later and had awful service. I could go into detail about the awful service, forgetting ordered items, being ignored and the general distasteful appearance of the staff. I don't mind tattoos and piercings, I have some! I was even a waitress for 7 years, but you should really brush your hair, shower, or wear socks to work.\n\nIf you like great food, drinks and atmosphere and can stand the idiots they hire to serve you. Then definitely eat here. I will continue to be a regular, I just wish their management would shape up those servers. I would recommend the Mesa location over the Tempe one. The Mesa one added new menu items, I ate there about 3 weeks ago and received great service. The Tempe one continues to disappoint. Although the food is always top notch.",

(hello Republic Ramen Noodles!). \n\nAnywho, I decided to check out Cornish Pasty Co based on the fact that my friends seemed to go there a lot, and I had heard nothing but good things about this restaurant. Last night we went, around dinner rush. The place was packed and I didnt know it was a \"seat yourself\" establishment. Our server directed us all the way to the back where we shared a table with some other people. This place has a really cozy feel, its definitely not a restaurant fit for large groups of people. I went with my boyfriend and his brother. I got the Lovely Bit o' Salmon pasty, boyfriend got the Meat & Cheese, and his brother got the Cajun Chicken. We also ordered the oven chips. It took a bit to get our food, but I didn't really mind. When we finally got our order, it was well worth the wait. The Salmon pasty (filled with salmon, asparagus, red potatoes, tomatoes and spinach) was delicious.. especially that dill sauce it came with. The oven chips were amazing as well! My boyfriend and his brother absolutely loved their pasties as well. I even got to try the meat & cheese.. WOW. So good. I'm a sucker for anything cheesy! \n\nAtmosphere wise, the place is really laid back, I liked how a lot of the people there had tattoos and I didnt feel like myself or any of the people I was with were being judged..sometimes we get treated differently just based off the fact that we have tattoos at places which is a big bummer! I did notice this place must be a hipster hangout since I saw a gaggle of them going out the back door, hahaha. \n\nI will definitely be back, as long as I'm good on my diet the rest of the week.. hahah.",

Well, Cornish Pasty is nothing like that.  It did not disappoint.  Great atmosphere, service, prices, and of course amazing food.\n\nWe started with cups of homemade soup.  The split pea was fantastic.  Definitely worth navigating around the little bits of ham, which, as the waitress had assured me, were not too terribly prevalent in the soup.  Sorry, ham - I don't like you.  My friend's cream of tomato soup was delicious as well.  \n\nWe then shared the rosemary chicken pasty.  I'll be honest: this was not among my top 5 pasty choices on the menu, but my desire to share rather than order my own and eat myself sick prevailed and I decided to be flexible.  It's always nice to be flexible anyway, right?  \n\nIn speaking with our server, we found out that the pastys are made ahead of time so they can't really be customized.  Normally I might be appalled by that, but there's so much crap in there that maybe it would take an hour to prepare them on the spot, and with so many menu options you should be able find one that you wouldn't want to modify.  So I'm okay with the pre-made factor.  My sixth choice pasty actually managed to wow me.  The bread and all the ingredients complimented each other perfectly and tasted great with the accompanying sauce.\n\nI can see why Cornish Pasty has such a loyal following.  Can't wait to bring some more friends there for the oohs and aahs and exclamations of 'how did you find this great place?!'  The credit goes to Yelp.",

            "text": "I am reviewing the original Tempe location.  Given all the great reviews this place has gotten, I was wondering what I could add that hasn't already been said.  It's not only the only place in Tempe you can get a cornish pasty, but they are also freak'n awesome.  The Lovely Bit of Salmon was my favorite, but alas given my newly discovered gluten intolerance I am not able to part-take in such loveliness any more:  :(\n\nBut nevertheless, I still come here every now and then with my friends and husband.  They all chow down on the yummy pasties while I chow down on my salads, sides, and soups.  So, I decided to concentrate my review on those items. (Some of these dishes are not gluten free.  I had them before I found out about my gluten intolerance.) \n\nSoups:\nThey offer a variety of soups.  I have tried: 1) the cream of leek, potato, and stilton, 2) the cream of tomato and crouton, and 3) the red pepper, black bean, rice, chicken, and jalapeno.  They were all very good, but I was informed that only the red pepper one is gluten free.  I had the first two before I found out about my gluten intolerance.  Not only are their soups really tasty, full of flavor, they are all also accompanied by thick slices of fresh bread and butter, baked and churned in-house.  Absolutely delicious!  The are perfect accompaniments, and a bowl at $4.75 would make a tasty and light lunch that won't break the bank.  \n\nSides: \nThe garlic mashed potatoes and the garlic roasted potatoes are also very good.  Pretty much what you should expect.  Creamy mashed potatoes and nicely roasted red potatoes with a hint of garlic.  Not too garlicky.  \n\nThe mushy peas is one of my favorite side dishes that they serve.  I think I prefer them to the potatoes simply because they are something different that I can't get anywhere else.  And these ain't  no ordinary peas.  They are huge for peas.  Cooked really well.  Not too mushy (overcooked), even though they are \"mushy\" peas. There is a great texture and freshness to this dish.  The texture of these \"mushy peas\" is more like crunchy peanut butter than creamy peanut butter if we were speaking of peanut butter that is (it's an analogy. . . just go with it), and I think the freshness and the texture go hand in hand from not overcooking the peas.  \n\nThe broccoli and cauliflower cheese bake is also a nice dish.  It makes me think of mac'n cheese, but with cauliflower and broccoli instead of mac noodles.  I dont think this dish is gluten free.  It seems to be made with a cheese sauce that is thickened with a flour rue, then baked to give a nice golden, crusted top.  It was tasty as well, but could have used a bit more seasoning.  It was my least favorite of all the sides I have had. \n\nAll their salads are also pretty good.  The veggies in the salad are pretty much the same regardless of which salad you get: ice berg lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and onions.  Except for the Greek and pasta.  The Greek has feta and olives, and the pasta has a whole list of its own ingredients.  \n\nWhat differentiates the various salads are the additions and the dressing.  Beside the basic garden and Greek, the three other salads to choose from are: 1) the salmon or chicken caesar, 2) the chicken tikka salad, and 3) the sausage salad.  The salmon caesar is a great substitute for the Lovely Bit of Salmon pasty.  The salmon is cooked very well.  Juicy, not overcooked and not undercooked, seasoned just like the salmon in the Lovely Bit of Salmon.  Ask for a side of the white wine and dill dressing that usually accompanies the Lovely Bit of Salmon and you will not regret it.  That sauce is amazing.  This is my favorite salad. The chicken tikka is also good.  The chicken is marinated in a red rub or spice, like what you would find with tandoori chicken, and served on a salad with yogurt dressing.  Finally, the sausage salad was not my favorite.  They make the sausage in house, but I was a bit disappointed with the flavor and the way it was cooked.  It was overcooked, very dry, and a bit off.  I'm not sure if I would order it again.  I've had it twice and it was the same both times.\n\nOverall, this is one of the best restaurants in Tempe!",

I wanted an Odell Isolation but they said they ran out so I went with a Union Jack IPA (az local) and was pleasantly surprised by the price when we received our check that it was only $4, awesome deal! \nI normally eat vegan so I asked about the vegan pastie specials (two choices daily) They had quite a few vegan options on the menu (like 10) but all of them included a fake meat (Quorn brand) and I am not a fan of vegan food trying to be like \"normal\" food, just wanted veggies and nothing fake. She said one special was a \"Philly cheese steak style\" and the other was a spinach artichoke which sounded like what I wanted. My BF ordered the chicken pot pie one cause he knew that would be hard to mess up. He really enjoyed his, its what he was expecting - perfect and legit. \nMine arrived and I noticed mine looked different which I expected. I also noticed it had Daiya cheese on it which I wasn't expecting, I wish the server would have mentioned that cause I am not really a fan. To me Daiya has such a strong distinct flavor that it usually takes over whatever its on or in. This was no exception but I felt Like this time it was at least semi balanced where it didn't totally take it over but it was definitely a predominate taste. I know lots of vegans like that cheese but I'm a weirdo and would rather forgo fake cheese. \nHis crust was tasty since it had real butter and mine was a bit drier but still surprisingly good, even the boyfriend was stealing some from my plate.\nNext time I'm just gonna get a non vegan one so I can get the full experience, I really wanted to try a curry one (with no fake meat).\nOverall awesome experience and when u are there you feel like you are in a place of history, even if you are not - I am not sure ;)",

It's definitely a hipster crowd but not in a way that will make you sick to your stomach if you're not so hipster.  The tables are mostly long picnic table style which makes the scene effortlessly chill.\n\nThe menu concept is simple yet eclectic.  It's a menu full of pasties with so many variations for every taste bud out there.  There's the classic British ones and also some fun twists on Italian, Greek and Mexican flavors.  My favorite part of the menu is that they have a whole selection of pasties that are meatless and vegan.  They use meat substitute that tastes delicious!  It's a really nice treat for any vegetarians or vegans out there who are sick of eating salads at every restaurant.  \n\nI recommend visiting Cornish often and with all of your favorite people in life!  It won't let you down as long as your embrace it for what it is - inexpensive and chill",

So, if you come alone, no worries...prepare to be entertained by the huge staff working in the kitchen (which is right across the bar from you).

Where do you want to go?\" It is a bit tucked away in a little strip mall, so I'm going to chalk it up to location and not the fact that I typically have the memory of a gnat.\n\nIf you've never had a pasty (pronounced pah-stee, unlike the pay-stee nipple adhesives strippers wear), you're missing out on a hearty English Hot Pocket. However, likening it to a Hot Pocket does it a disservice. Hot Pockets consist of cardboard crust filled with nuclear hot goo that causes blisters and cursing, rather than sighs of content and delight. While both are great drunk/hangover food, the Cornish Pasty Co. far surpasses the measly freezer dried Hot Pocket. \n\nWhile they have flavors that are also available as Hot Pocket varieties (taste test!), my dining partner routinely reminds me that he will shun me for indulge in one of those. Not that it's hard to find at least five different flavors that you could imagine chowing down. I always end up just blurting out my decision at the last minute to end my indecisiveness. They updated the menu recently and it now includes a bunch of flavors that weren't previously available, like carne adovada. Mmm. So if you haven't been here in a while, give it another go and try something new.\n\nFor about seven bucks you get a huge, stick-to-your-ribs pastry filled with a wide variety of meats and vegetables. I've never tried the vegetarian choices, but there are quite a few on the menu (about half as many as the non-vegetarian options). Among the traditional pasties, you can't go wrong with the oggie, shepards pie or lamb and mint. I've tried the chicken tikka masala, greek chicken, and lamb vindaloo from the fancy schmancy options and they were just as stellar. The greek salad is also pretty respectable, with a hefty amount of kalamata olives and feta cheese. \n\nWatching the cooks at work is part of the fun at this place, so have a seat at the bar. Just make sure to do so far enough away from the oven that you won't end up dried out like beef jerky at the end of your meal. When you get the bill, there's a cashier near the door that you can cash out at if you're in a hurry, since the servers are a little bit on the slow side. Slow, laid back, whatever. \n\nTheir happy hour is also an awesome option to opt for, and is offered every day from 3 to 5 pm. There's a dollar off beers, three dollar Irish car bombs and two dollar top shelf shots (Ketel One vodka, Jameson whiskey, etc.), so if you're looking to spend an afternoon getting stinko and munching on some awesome food, this is the place to be.\n\nUPDATE: I've tried just about every non-veggie pasty on the menu. The salmon trumps them all. Do it.",

What I got was a good hot pocket full of chicken and some sauce. Not nearly has juicy and spicy as I had imagined it would be, but still good. I chose the peanut butter and jelly pasty for a dessert to take home with me. When I got home and baked it, I took a bite and it was peanut butter and apple jelly? I was confused.

An eclectic list of Pasty's both 'traditional,' 'signature,' and 'premium' plus a collection of soups, salads, and sides I asked Hannah about portions on her return and told that each pasty clocked in at approximately a pound (and that two would be \"way too much\" food for a solo diner since she could only eat half of one) thus leading me to settle on a single option, a dish I was told would take \"about fifteen minutes,\" leaving me more time to study and enjoy the tunes - the White Stripes perhaps the only thing 'un-British' in a string of songs ranging from Zeppelin to The Beatles to The Ramones.\n\nReading as I waited and enjoying the room as well as watching the team slice meat, shape dough, and chop vegetables it would be just under a quarter hour before my dish arrived and although smaller than I'd imagined (I definitely could have eaten two - probably three if I didn't have dessert and dinner plans) the Shepherd's Pie that was presented was far better than I'd have ever expected, a golden buttery shell wrapped around lightly mint tinged lamb and although fatty and intense nicely balanced by the vegetables.  Generally a fan of Shepherd's Pie, particularly when using a sharp cheddar, this handheld version would prove to be an exemplary take on the classic and the addition of a sidecar of onion and sage laden red wine gravy certainly did not hurt.\n\nDebating a second pasty as Hannah returned to check in on me (The Pilgrim sounds quite good) but subsequently turning my attention to the sweeter half of the menu I decided to not make the same mistake twice and inquiring as to which dessert she recommended I went with my gut and ordered two to arrive with a delay between them, the first \"Shirley Temple's Pudding,\" a $6 sticky toffee pudding served in a cast iron pot with a side of crème anglaise.  Rich and thick, a dark treacle just barely set at the center and almost a brownie consistency along the edges what really shined about this dish was the manner in which it worked with the crème, a thick but delicate sauce balancing out the intense sweetness of the pudding.\n\nMoving next to my second dessert, and for my tastes the better of the two, a goodly delay of fifteen minutes brought to the table Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding with vanilla ice cream - a truly unique spin on bread pudding made with what almost seemed to be cracker-thin pieces of bread juxtaposing a brandy tinged chocolate sauce and baked much like the sticky toffee pudding to be set at the edges yet dense and moist at the center.  Truly a decadent dessert - the sort begging for a glass of milk or coffee - I will say that the ice cream was rather run-of-the-mill vanilla and although it served its purpose admirably I'd definitely go with more anglaise on subsequent visits - visits which I'm sure will happen the next time I find myself drawn back to Tempe, or to Mesa where there is apparently a second location whose Banoffee Pie and Apple Caramel Pasties seem to be calling.",

Finally, if you're a beer drinker, I think you'll be quite pleased with the variety of beers on tap.",

The server didn't know which Vegan Pasties were available that night so she checked, it was only the Vegan Greek Pasty (the menu stated at least two available on any given night). As a vegan, that was my option, so that I got (with a side of chips). \n\nA good twenty minutes later everything comes out. The pasty was ok at first, full of sun-dried tomatoes and artichoke hearts. About halfway through I bite into a huge chunk of Mozarella (not vegan) and put the rest down. The only vegan option available that night was in fact not vegan. Really guys? At least the chips were ok.\n\nWaited a good twenty minutes after I was clearly done eating before my server offered a check and to-go box. Overall the service was extremely slow and inconsiderate (I didn't really feel welcome), the vegan food wasn't vegan, and I still paid $15.00 for what amounted to a sandwich and fries.

If you come with more than 1 (2 at the absolute most) people, forget it. There are two booth-table hybrids, way in the back, but be warned that your server will inform you that at any time, no matter how awkward, complete strangers are allowed to just plop down next to you at the same table and join your party. If you are a Larry David type individual with a need for personal space, you're gonna have a bad time. If it fits, they sits. \n\nAs far as the service goes, the soup de jour is \"I don't give a shit.\" \n\nOne time we asked for straws and our server just chucked them at us. I've asked \"do you have any seats available?\" and been told \"I don't know, go look.\" We've had employees actually ask us to move, along with all of our stuff, to a different table (yes, really) to accommodate another group. I've been given dirty looks for asking for a slice of lemon in my water.

An eclectic list of Pasty's both 'traditional,' 'signature,' and 'premium' plus a collection of soups, salads, and sides I asked Hannah about portions on her return and told that each pasty clocked in at approximately a pound (and that two would be \"way too much\" food for a solo diner since she could only eat half of one) thus leading me to settle on a single option, a dish I was told would take \"about fifteen minutes,\" leaving me more time to study and enjoy the tunes - the White Stripes perhaps the only thing 'un-British' in a string of songs ranging from Zeppelin to The Beatles to The Ramones.\n\nReading as I waited and enjoying the room as well as watching the team slice meat, shape dough, and chop vegetables it would be just under a quarter hour before my dish arrived and although smaller than I'd imagined (I definitely could have eaten two - probably three if I didn't have dessert and dinner plans) the Shepherd's Pie that was presented was far better than I'd have ever expected, a golden buttery shell wrapped around lightly mint tinged lamb and although fatty and intense nicely balanced by the vegetables.  Generally a fan of Shepherd's Pie, particularly when using a sharp cheddar, this handheld version would prove to be an exemplary take on the classic and the addition of a sidecar of onion and sage laden red wine gravy certainly did not hurt.\n\nDebating a second pasty as Hannah returned to check in on me (The Pilgrim sounds quite good) but subsequently turning my attention to the sweeter half of the menu I decided to not make the same mistake twice and inquiring as to which dessert she recommended I went with my gut and ordered two to arrive with a delay between them, the first \"Shirley Temple's Pudding,\" a $6 sticky toffee pudding served in a cast iron pot with a side of crème anglaise.  Rich and thick, a dark treacle just barely set at the center and almost a brownie consistency along the edges what really shined about this dish was the manner in which it worked with the crème, a thick but delicate sauce balancing out the intense sweetness of the pudding.\n\nMoving next to my second dessert, and for my tastes the better of the two, a goodly delay of fifteen minutes brought to the table Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding with vanilla ice cream - a truly unique spin on bread pudding made with what almost seemed to be cracker-thin pieces of bread juxtaposing a brandy tinged chocolate sauce and baked much like the sticky toffee pudding to be set at the edges yet dense and moist at the center.  Truly a decadent dessert - the sort begging for a glass of milk or coffee - I will say that the ice cream was rather run-of-the-mill vanilla and although it served its purpose admirably I'd definitely go with more anglaise on subsequent visits - visits which I'm sure will happen the next time I find myself drawn back to Tempe, or to Mesa where there is apparently a second location whose Banoffee Pie and Apple Caramel Pasties seem to be calling.",

The Pilgrim Pasty (pronounced past-ee, not pastey) delivers Thanksgiving year round, and the Chicken Tikka pasty brings you all the way to India. Their scratch-made bread is the best we've EVER had, and it is even better when dunked in their potato-leek-cheese soup. But wait- there's more. You have to save room to share the Chocolate Bread pudding! They serve it with liquid cream or ice cream (or both) and we cry every time we finish it because we have just tasted heaven and have to go back to the real world. Just eat here and thank me later.",

And I would say any more and it would be too much. The Sauce that came with it was necessary to cool off your mouth, and it helped that it was very tasty and refreshing! \n\nI am looking forward to going back and trying the many different pastries they have.\n\nBut please don't let me forget to mention dessert aka creamy heavenly goodness, that is the peanut butter and jelly pastry.

I have learned to order one pasty for lunch, and get another to-go for later-- because knowing me, I will have a second craving during the day.\n\n  The first time I went I courageously tried their Chicken Tikka Masala pasty. My grandfather is from India, and I was raised on traditional Indian food, so I was a skeptic. However, their take on chicken masala (typically consisting of chicken, red curry, potatoes, vegetables and accompanied with rice) was impressive. There was just the right amount of curry to chicken to vegetable ratio, and I could not help but want to scarf it down. It was mild, so anyone could love it. Even their Vegetarian Tikka Masala pasty is delicious. As a former vegetarian and vegan, I am always skeptical when trying new meat substitutes, but the Quorn chicken substitute has a great consistency. \n \nAnother time I went, I tried their Shepherd's Pie Pasty, and declared that a victory. The pastry shell was crisp, the filling was flavorful, and the peas and carrots hadn't gone to mush. You can tell that they make the pasties (pastys?) fresh just by biting into them, but if you're not convinced, sit up at the bar and watch. \n\n  I will say, one of the best pasties they have is their Lovely Bit a Salmon. It took me a while to be able to order it because every time I tried, they were sold out (AND FOR GOOD REASONING!). I got lucky one unassuming Tuesday afternoon while ordering delivery for my mother, my roommate and myself. They were surprisingly prompt in their delivery and didn't seem to get lost with my crappy directions to my apartment. I ordered the Salmon, my mother the Pilgrim (SOOOO GOOD), and my roommate the Cheese Steak ( I didn't try his, but he said it was awesome). The Salmon pasty was heaven. I am not kidding- HEAVEN wrapped in a delicate pastry blanket and hand delivered from The Almighty Himself. The salmon was cooked to perfection, the dill sauce was mild, the asparagus still al dente, the potatoes were perfect, and the tomatoes and spinach were an added plus. \n\n My new favorite \"every-now-and-again\" pasty is The Peanut Butter and Jelly. HOLY GUACAMOLE! They have taken the traditional PB&J and slapped it in the face sent it home to it's momma. Then added some refinement, and some ooey-gooey, yummy in my tummy, goody-goody gumdrops to it. Holy Toledo. The banana is welcomed added bonus.  \n \nTo be honest, I have yet to try a pasty there that I do not like. This is a great thing, yet can be very unhelpful when trying to figure out what to have for lunch or dinner. \n\n Maybe someone can help me... I do not know what is in their salad dressing for their basic green salad... but it is AMAZING! \n Their garlic roasted potatoes and mushy peas are so yummy as well. \n\n They have my two drink requirements on tap: Guinness and Boddingtons. Also, they have Duvel which is one of my favorite Belgian beers for a moderate price. They have great Happy Hour drink specials including $3 car bombs. $3! YOU CAN'T BEAT THAT!\n\n Dine in, take out, or delivery. It doesn't matter how you get it, just GET IT! Make sure that if you order their green salad you get extra dressing--you will be happy that you did.",

I like that you can watch the food prep opera at the bar as they are continually putting together new pasties to keep up the supplies or, one of my new favorites, when the weather is nice, sit at the outside patio to enjoy the cool weather and the piped out music, which is audible but not overpowering.\n\nMy favorite pasties, which are a welsh savory pastry, are:\n\nThe Peppered Steak\nThe Greek (vegetarian)\n\nI'm also a big fan of their incredibly fresh house salads with pesto dressing - a regular is good enough for two people or half works for a single serving. I understand there are now locations in Mesa and Old Town Scottsdale but this was the original location and dare I say it, still my favorite. Worth checking out if you are looking for a place with good food and good beer, and people watching is always fun due to the location close to the University, it has a significant bohemian vibe and though I'm not a hipster (too old and too fat), it is fun to mingle with the more visible members of the creative class that Richard Florida writes about.",

            "text": "Apparently hailing from the British city of Cornwall and here in Arizona finding its foothold at the appropriately named Cornish Pasty Company I had originally heard of the pasty during a recent trip to Philadelphia where the baked crescent was a daily special on the menu at The Dandelion but featuring the least the combination of beef, rutabaga, onion, and potato I cannot really say my interest as high - a situation remedied by the extensive (if inauthentic selection at Cornish Pasty Company and thus leading me through their doors just after 2:30pm where I'd find the small bar area still full but the larger dining room only perhaps half so.\n\nLargely unaware of the logistics of CPC - whether you seat yourself or wait to be seated and whether you order at the counter or at a table I stood and watched for a moment before deciding to seat myself and within moments a friendly young woman named Hannah greeted me, first offering a beverage - just water - and subsequently the restaurant's extensive menu which I browsed at length while listening to The Sex Pistols and then The Clash play overhead.  An eclectic list of Pasty's both 'traditional,' 'signature,' and 'premium' plus a collection of soups, salads, and sides I asked Hannah about portions on her return and told that each pasty clocked in at approximately a pound (and that two would be \"way too much\" food for a solo diner since she could only eat half of one) thus leading me to settle on a single option, a dish I was told would take \"about fifteen minutes,\" leaving me more time to study and enjoy the tunes - the White Stripes perhaps the only thing 'un-British' in a string of songs ranging from Zeppelin to The Beatles to The Ramones.\n\nReading as I waited and enjoying the room as well as watching the team slice meat, shape dough, and chop vegetables it would be just under a quarter hour before my dish arrived and although smaller than I'd imagined (I definitely could have eaten two - probably three if I didn't have dessert and dinner plans) the Shepherd's Pie that was presented was far better than I'd have ever expected, a golden buttery shell wrapped around lightly mint tinged lamb and although fatty and intense nicely balanced by the vegetables.  Generally a fan of Shepherd's Pie, particularly when using a sharp cheddar, this handheld version would prove to be an exemplary take on the classic and the addition of a sidecar of onion and sage laden red wine gravy certainly did not hurt.\n\nDebating a second pasty as Hannah returned to check in on me (The Pilgrim sounds quite good) but subsequently turning my attention to the sweeter half of the menu I decided to not make the same mistake twice and inquiring as to which dessert she recommended I went with my gut and ordered two to arrive with a delay between them, the first \"Shirley Temple's Pudding,\" a $6 sticky toffee pudding served in a cast iron pot with a side of crème anglaise.  Rich and thick, a dark treacle just barely set at the center and almost a brownie consistency along the edges what really shined about this dish was the manner in which it worked with the crème, a thick but delicate sauce balancing out the intense sweetness of the pudding.\n\nMoving next to my second dessert, and for my tastes the better of the two, a goodly delay of fifteen minutes brought to the table Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding with vanilla ice cream - a truly unique spin on bread pudding made with what almost seemed to be cracker-thin pieces of bread juxtaposing a brandy tinged chocolate sauce and baked much like the sticky toffee pudding to be set at the edges yet dense and moist at the center.  Truly a decadent dessert - the sort begging for a glass of milk or coffee - I will say that the ice cream was rather run-of-the-mill vanilla and although it served its purpose admirably I'd definitely go with more anglaise on subsequent visits - visits which I'm sure will happen the next time I find myself drawn back to Tempe, or to Mesa where there is apparently a second location whose Banoffee Pie and Apple Caramel Pasties seem to be calling.",

ALL of them.  There are only a few of the veggie pasties I haven't tried.  Outside of the original and traditional ones, though, the Rosemary Chicken and the Pilgrim have to be my favorites.  There's no need for side dishes or appetizer breads or anything, since every delicious bite you need comes wrapped up neatly in an egg-brushed pastry pocket fresh out of the oven.  It's exactly the right amount of food.\n\nThe owner is an extremely friendly, knowledgeable, and cool fella, and he's always looking at ways to make his business better.  He's chosen a great crew to meet the increasing demands of this growing hot spot, since everyone who works there is nice and down-to-earth.  I've never seen a single employee lounging or wasting time there.\n\nWhat they do really, really well:  (1) All of the FOOD, including the salads and desserts.  (2) The beer selection is incredible, full of tasty imports and domestics both on tap and in bottles.  (3) The prices are excellent.  (4) The decor is sleek and modern, complete with classic rock playing at a quiet yet audible volume.\n\nWhat they could improve on:  There's very little room for parties of 4.  There's plenty of counter space, a handful of tables for 2, and a custom table for 3 that's kind of neat, but the small area at the back that used to be smaller tables is now one large table.  Parties of 4 now take up the whole area (that could seat up to 8), making it awkward for any other big parties coming in.  Plus, you can't cut through tables to sit on the bench side of the booth anymore.  You have to scoot down the length of the table and then push everyone out again if you have to get up for any reason.  (A very small fault, considering that everything else about the place is incredible!)\n\nOverall, this is one of Tempe's best little restaurants.  Whenever I'm not craving food from a particular location, pasties have become the default food for my whole household.  They're always tasty and we just never get tired of them.  I have to move out of state soon, and of all the places we've eaten in our 10 years here, I will miss the Cornish Pasty Company the most!!!",

I guess this place wasn't known for salads so I think next time I would get what they are known for. My friend got the bangers and mash. It was so good.

We decided to sit outside at the patio to enjoy the Fall weather. \n\nI got the Oggie and my friend got Shepard's pie with a side Oven Chips - added the garlic and jalepenos. I love anything pie crust and these pasties definitely hit the spot.  The minced lamb from the Shepard's pie was  cooked perfectly and not too gamey. The Oggie was a classic and a comfort food. Oven chips were like french fries cooked with minced garlic and jalepenos that weren't spicy at all. I found out there's a location in Vegas and will definitely have to visit there to try the other pasties.",

My favorite among the savory pasties is the cottage pie pasty. Well, is it even possible to go wrong with seasoned ground beef, mashed potatoes, cheddar cheese, carrots and peas all stuffed into a buttery, flaky pie? I think not.\n\nThe chicken tikka masala pasty contains diced potatoes and green peppers (not what you'd expect in chicken tikka masala) along with curried chicken. \n\nThe sweet pasties are great, but they are a rather large portion for dessert. The sticky toffee pudding is some of the best I've ever had. \n\nThe interior of the restaurant is very dark. Not sure what kind of effect the owners were going for, but whatever it was, it was completely lost on me. \n\nThe Cornish Pasty Company started in the Phoenix area, and has expanded into cities like Las Vegas and Boston.

After a short wait we were sat which meant the hostess told us she saw two empty seats at the bar...back on the other side. So, getting sat was a bit of an experiment. They are obviously still adjusting to the new expansion but it didn't affect the service too much. I got a 20 oz. Murphey's Red Ale which was fantastic. Perfect amount of foam on the beer, didn't let off any of the carbonation with a shitty pour. I had time to finish my beer before my pasty came out which was a bit long but permissible since it was rather busy. The pasty itself ( Balsamic Portabello) was very slightly under cooked but forgivable again. We were still in and out of the place in a little over an hour and had a great time with good service. The only reason I won't give them a 5 is because they could stand to create a better system for seating people now that they are a much larger establishment. Overall still great",

It is more crunchy and flaky, in a good way and they seemed to have figured out how to make them repeatably good.\n\nAfter a full day of hiking and walking around in the sun and sand of the Arizona desert we decided to stop by here for some much needed good food. My friends swore by this food, but I was a little skeptical as I am not the biggest fan of flaky things as main course. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala Pasty and it was awesome. I completely loved it. They did such a good job with the flavors and the pasty also complemented it very well. I might end up ordering this exact same thing if I go there again. My friends had mentioned that the Pesto Chicken Pasty is also very good and might be on the list of things to try next.\n\nWe tried some deserts also. We had the Strawberry Pavlova and the Chocolate Bread And Butter Pudding. Both were very good and worth having again, but I have a bias towards chocolate so will say that I loved the Chocolate Bread And Butter Pudding a little more. The warm, moist and flavorful inside with the crunchy and yet flavorful outside made for a killer combination.

You cant go wrong with anything on the menu, and by now I've had almost everything!  My favorite of all time is the Chicken Greek and it amazes me with every bite!  What is a pasty you ask?  This is a common question, and I've never experienced them before I found this place or have really ever seen them anywhere else.  They are kind of like a calzone, but instead of the ingredients being encased in a pizza dough crust, it is more like a pie crust.  Super yummy!  And these are no ordinary pasties, they are gourmet pasties.  A close second to the Chicken Greek is the Spicy Asiago Chicken for me.  With around 38 different types of pasties, everyone can find something they will want to try, as well as an impressive vegetarian selection.  The ambiance is excellent too.  You really feel like you're in a European Pub and not tucked away in a random strip mall in Tempe.  The beer selection is very nice and the wait staff is always friendly and helpful.  This is a true pub atmosphere and is pretty dark inside and does get quite busy during peak hours.  Most of the inside seating are old church pews on each side of very long tables.  Several parties can comfortably sit at each of these tables, but there really isn't anything separating these long tables and pews, and there is potential for your small group to be \"invaded\" by a larger group moving in on that table.  I love the look of the church pews and dimly lit candle light that adds to the Gothic feel to the place though, and have only once felt a little \"taken over\" by a bigger group (was a Fri night) in all my years of coming here.  They have a very nice outside patio with more separated tables, which is an excellent option during the cooler times of the year here.  I remember when this was a teeny tiny little place serving amazing food and am very happy for the owner's success and their incredible expansion, not only to the neighboring suites at this location, but through out the valley and beyond!

It's still good heated up the next day.\n\nWhat I like the most about this place is the food comes out remarkably quick.  I've gone for lunch on various occasions, arriving around 11:45 each time.  I've gone with one person or with 4 or 5 other people and the food always came out in a reasonable amount of time - even with the restaurant packed to the hilt with hungry folks.  I give them an A+ for their speed given their popularity.\n\nThis establishment is fairly odd in a quirky way that makes you want to return.  The decor has \"character\".  I suppose the intention is to replicate a English Pub.  I'm not sure.  They expanded the dinging room in recent years and the new dining room is full of these very long tables where the seating looks like what used to be a church bench.  A little awkward whilst you try to chump down on your pasty.  Nonetheless and church bench aside, however you have to sit, its definitely worth your time to visit this establishment.",

The crust of the pasties were so PERFECT. Beautifully flacky and not soggy even though inside of the pasty was filled with steaming potatoes and meat. \n\nDON'T skimp out on the desserts either!! Their caramel apple crumble pasty was AMAZING. Just like the pasties for the shepherds pie or the bashers and mash, the apple crumb was encased in the lovely pasty crust. It not overly sweet like many other desserts even though it was drenched with warm caramel on top. I don't typically get desserts but I was just feeling it on this day.

A slight step up from a hole in the wall type of place, this quaint spot serves up good, tasty, and satisfying food hot from the kitchen.\n\nWhat is a pasty?\n\nA pasty's history can be associated with the tin miners in England.  The story goes that these miners were covered head to toe in dust and other nasty stuff and would eat these calzone like dishes as a means to have nourishment without the need to return to the surface.  Supposedly, the miners were able to eat the pastry like food by holding onto the \"handles\" and when done, discard the tainted remains into the mine thereby appeasing the spirits that haunted the mines.\n\nAt the Cornish Pasty Co. I can first hand recommend the Chicken Pesto.  Very good flavoring and filling.  Or you can go with the more traditional route with beef, potatoes, and swede.  The sauces that come with your pasty are there to accent the flavors and are highly recommend to try as well.\n\nPros\n* Good food\n* Originality\n* Portions\n* Customer service\n* Coat hooks at the bar\n\nCons\n* Small interior",

I see his point, since the fowl in my pasty was perfectly prepared.\n\nI told our friendly server about Yelp. She had never heard of it, but I said she should check it out - that Cornish Pasty Co. has some outstanding reviews. She said she would be sure to let the owners know. Then she let us know they are opening up another location soon that is family-friendly, with plans for a 3rd in a couple years. Mo' Pasty = Mo' Betta' \n\nCornish Pasty, I will be back! You have quite the beer selection, including 3 sizes on draft to choose from... including Rogue's Hazelnut Brown! Not to mention alot of bottles. \n\nYep. I'm coming back soon.

For the basics, this is a British Pub that serves Pasty's. A pasty is the British version of a hot pocket or their take on the calzone, kinda. It is more crunchy and flaky, in a good way and they seemed to have figured out how to make them repeatably good.\n\nAfter a full day of hiking and walking around in the sun and sand of the Arizona desert we decided to stop by here for some much needed good food. My friends swore by this food, but I was a little skeptical as I am not the biggest fan of flaky things as main course. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala Pasty and it was awesome. I completely loved it. They did such a good job with the flavors and the pasty also complemented it very well. I might end up ordering this exact same thing if I go there again. My friends had mentioned that the Pesto Chicken Pasty is also very good and might be on the list of things to try next.\n\nWe tried some deserts also. We had the Strawberry Pavlova and the Chocolate Bread And Butter Pudding. Both were very good and worth having again, but I have a bias towards chocolate so will say that I loved the Chocolate Bread And Butter Pudding a little more. The warm, moist and flavorful inside with the crunchy and yet flavorful outside made for a killer combination. It tasted very good just by itself and also with the pudding/ice cream.\n\nI look forward to going to this place again.",

I recommend this place to everyone and I try to visit at least every couple months or so. Every time someone visits from out of town, I make sure to bring them there.

I only have 1 of my own, and its never stopped me from returning. I had one bad pasty, too much garlic. I can't say how many times I've visited, but its always been a very enjoyable experience. I will keep returning, keep talking them up and still bring in new visitors with me!! \n\nI love the Royale with Cheese, Cajun Chicken, Chicken Alfredo is my favorite, Pesto Chicken and Rosemary Chicken.

            "text": "Who doesn't like pastries??? And savory pastries, much less. An 'Oggie', is the classic pasty that is still savored in Cornwall and all over the UK today. After hearing so many locals rave about the famous pastry, I had to pay the Cornish Pastry Company a visit. Talk about a British pub. This place mimics the dark, mysterious alley pubs in England. The restaurant is dim, moody and spacious with pool tables, a huge bar area and a misted patio. The vibe was very mellow on a weekday afternoon, but I can imagine it gets fairly busy on the weekends. After studying the extensive list of pastries (over two dozen), I went with the Carne Adovada from the premium list and the Cajun Chicken from the signature list and a side of the the broccoli cauliflower bake.\n\nThe broccoli cauliflower bake was delivered first. Think: healthy take on mac and cheese without giving up any of the flavor. The broccoli cauliflower dish was swimming in this wonderful cheese sauce and baked with tons of cheese on top creating a perfectly crisp exterior. Definitely delicious and a must order. \n\nThe pastries came next. Similar to a calzone but a lot less doughy, and a lot more flakey; the dough recipe is perfect because it is not overpowering to the savory delicious fillings. The Adovada was filled with simmered pork in New Mexican red chili stew, Mexican rice, hatch chilies and cheddar with a side of sour cream and salsa (the sides are switched in the photos). The pork was so tender and flavorful and the stew and chilies added a perfect kick. This was a British take on a Mexican influenced dish and it was a winner. The Cajun Chicken was filled with spicy cajun chicken breast, bacon, ham and Swiss and served with a side of chipotle sauce. The chicken was tender and the bacon added the right amount of smokiness paired with the chipotle sauce. I enjoyed this pastry as well, but the Adovada was the winner.\n\nWith so many options to choose from, you really can't go wrong here. I spend about fifteen minutes on the menu trying to decide which pasty to choose. There is something for everyone here with flavors ranging form Spanish influence, to Indian influence, to Mediterranean influence. The service was on point as well. We were directed to the main seating area by the host and the waitress took time to point out some of her favorites on the menu. She didn't seem to be very knowledgable on what each pasty included and the sauces were switched on my pastries, but all was forgiven after the first bite. There is a large private parking lot for the restaurant with free parking available. I'll be back next time I'm in town.",

I was looking for a place to grab some good food and a couple beers before a concert so I checked out Yelp and it did not lead me astray.\n\nTo me, a place like this is why Yelp needs to exist.  It was not in the most obvious location and when the group I was with went to walk in the front door we almost didn't know we were in the right place.  Let's just say their limited space is used very efficiently.  For what this place lacks in size, it makes up in character.\n\nInside it was kind of dark with some chairs lining the bar long the open kitchen and on the other wall a few small tables.  We found our spot in the back which was probably the only table big enough for 6 people.  The place was full and the noise level was just right; busy, but comfortable to have some lively dinner conversation. (Especially after some Irish Car Bombs.)\n\nTheir draft beer selection stuck to the UK theme with a lot of beers from that region.  I was especially surprised to see some Strongbow Cider.  They also had a few good micro brews from places like Firestone and Rogue.  Between that selection and the 32 oz. monster glasses they'd serve it in, this place was already a winner.\n\nMost importantly, their food was excellent.  I had the TIki Masala pasty and my wife had the Chicken Greek.  The Tiki Masala would be a great dish served by itself in an Indian restaurant.  Put it in a pasty and it's game over.  I tasted my wife's Chicken Greek which I probably wouldn't have picked as one of my own top choices to order and it was awesome.\n\nWe unanimously agreed this place was great and we had a laugh about some review around here that compared it to a Hot Pocket.  LOL.  I'll have to save that one under, \"Knowing about good food - FAIL!\"",

It's in an odd location at a strip-mall that's tucked around the corner from a decent Mexican restaurant and a sub-shop.  \n\nI'm not sure if they're going for the feel of a mineshaft, but it was ridiculously cold in there.  I'm all for beating the heat, but to go from 104 to 62 degrees was a little much for me.  \n\nI could talk more about the ambiance, which is mildly interesting, but the food is the most important thing.  I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala (Red curry) which had chicken, potato, and the red curry sauce.  The chicken was dry, as well as the curry sauce.  Mere days before I'd had Chicken red curry at George and Dragon in Phoenix, which was really good.  The pasty was not on par with that.  I have to say it was one of the more bland curries I've ever had.  Perhaps I should have tried something like their Bangers and Mash or Shepherd's Pie.\n\nAs for the price, everything on the menu should cost about 20% less.  I think Cornish Pasty is WAY overpriced.  Some of the more traditional stuff is $7 to $7.50, while everything else is $8-9.  Beer is also a little on the pricey side (20 ounce drafts are $5-6) for this kind of place.  Two Boddington's and a pasty were $18 before tax and tip.  So if you absolutely have to have a pasty then I guess this is your place, otherwise there are some other fabulous places nearby that won't break the bank.",

I've had a hankering for a pasty for quite some time and thought I'd have to wait until my next trip to the upper Midwest. \n\nFor starters, I like the menu here. Places that do one thing and do it well rate highly with me, and this place does pasties. There are about a dozen different kinds of pasties on the menu ranging from traditional (beef & potatoes or chicken pot pie) to unusual (salmon or Mexican), for example. The pasties are pre-made and warmed up to order and come with sauces. The red wine gravy I tried was very good. There are a few side dishes like chips, slaw, and beans, and some good looking desserts. (I can't say how they tasted; I had a second Strongbow for dessert.) They have several beers on draft and some bottles, too. \n\nI thought the portion size was decent, but certainly not huge, and the prices fair, especially considering the next nearest pasty place is probably hundreds or thousands of miles away (aside from the CPC's other location, obviously). The pasty seemed authentic and pretty consistent with what I grew up with, but it was a bit salty and a bit dry, though the gravy helped. The flavors were good, though, and I enjoyed my Oggie (their main beef pasty). \n\nThe place is small, dark, and divey. There's a single row of tables mostly two-tops along one wall and about a dozen seats at the bar. Dark clothes, visible body piercings, and tattoos seem to be a prerequisite for employment at this place. I got the sense that this place turned into a heavy-metal bar in the evenings, though I could be wrong. I certainly enjoyed the Queen playing when I got there, and the two guys that waited on me at the bar were friendly, cool guys, and the service was efficient. \n\nThis is a place I'll visit whenever I'm in town.

Forget what anyone else has said...nothing could be better than the Eggplant Parmesan pastie! ;) My sister also loved her Lamb and Mint pastie, saying it was \"effing delicious\" and that the mint was not overpowering. The pastry is not doughy like pizza crust, but rather flaky and crispy like a biscuit. The vegetables were cooked perfectly, as they were fresh and still a little crunchy. \n\nLiterally my only complaint about this place is that my meal was so good I kept trying to bite into it while it was still hot, burning my mouth multiple times. I look forward to coming back the next time I'm visiting my sis in Tempe, as I know she's about to jump on the Cornish Pastry Co regular train! She already has the \"Pilgrim\" pastie picked out as her next one to try and at about $9/meal, I bet she'll have worked through most of the menu by the time I see her again.\n\nDefinitely put this on your \"must see\" list of places to eat (for lunch)!",

            "text": "Who doesn't like pastries??? And savory pastries, much less. An 'Oggie', is the classic pasty that is still savored in Cornwall and all over the UK today. After hearing so many locals rave about the famous pastry, I had to pay the Cornish Pastry Company a visit. Talk about a British pub. This place mimics the dark, mysterious alley pubs in England. The restaurant is dim, moody and spacious with pool tables, a huge bar area and a misted patio. The vibe was very mellow on a weekday afternoon, but I can imagine it gets fairly busy on the weekends. After studying the extensive list of pastries (over two dozen), I went with the Carne Adovada from the premium list and the Cajun Chicken from the signature list and a side of the the broccoli cauliflower bake.\n\nThe broccoli cauliflower bake was delivered first. Think: healthy take on mac and cheese without giving up any of the flavor. The broccoli cauliflower dish was swimming in this wonderful cheese sauce and baked with tons of cheese on top creating a perfectly crisp exterior. Definitely delicious and a must order. \n\nThe pastries came next. Similar to a calzone but a lot less doughy, and a lot more flakey; the dough recipe is perfect because it is not overpowering to the savory delicious fillings. The Adovada was filled with simmered pork in New Mexican red chili stew, Mexican rice, hatch chilies and cheddar with a side of sour cream and salsa (the sides are switched in the photos). The pork was so tender and flavorful and the stew and chilies added a perfect kick. This was a British take on a Mexican influenced dish and it was a winner. The Cajun Chicken was filled with spicy cajun chicken breast, bacon, ham and Swiss and served with a side of chipotle sauce. The chicken was tender and the bacon added the right amount of smokiness paired with the chipotle sauce. I enjoyed this pastry as well, but the Adovada was the winner.\n\nWith so many options to choose from, you really can't go wrong here. I spend about fifteen minutes on the menu trying to decide which pasty to choose. There is something for everyone here with flavors ranging form Spanish influence, to Indian influence, to Mediterranean influence. The service was on point as well. We were directed to the main seating area by the host and the waitress took time to point out some of her favorites on the menu. She didn't seem to be very knowledgable on what each pasty included and the sauces were switched on my pastries, but all was forgiven after the first bite. There is a large private parking lot for the restaurant with free parking available. I'll be back next time I'm in town.",

            "text": "Is it damning with faint praise to  say it's the best restaurant of its type when there's no analog within the city?      Until now  most of my experience with the pasties, or bridies as we called a  very similar dish In Scotland, has been uniformly  bad in the USA.  E.g  every  British theme pub has one on the menu  and seem to share the  same supplier.\n\nThis was so much better than I had hoped.  That they had draft cider too was  even better , a rarity in AZ, but perfect sense given the origin of the pasty in the English  West Country. Should have been Scrumpy ,a man can dream can't he? \n\nThe complaints about them not being traditional fillings is , well, odd. There wasn't a lot of variety in the UK diet,  less so on the working class end. So   On to the food.   Everything about the decor,  waiting time and suitability for groups is true.  Staff are friendly and  frankly it's nice to be left alone   rather than constant hovering. \n\nOnto the food. Pastry  rocks,  they've nailed it.   It supports the  contents right to the last.   \n\nFillings I had the Lamb Vindaloo which was close, but, but missing a sharpness/ e.g  vinegar, that I usually look for but it was still really good.  Dipping sauce complements it nicely.  My wife had the banger's and mash  version with  a red wine sauce.  Again  pretty good. \n\nSo why  four stars?    Many comments here have mentioned a lack of sensitivity  with regards to the flavors/ herbs and the thyme was   way overused on the bangers/mash gravy and it's  a shame as you could taste what they were trying to get at. Additionally the price may seem like a little on the high side ( would be  daily)  but  think about what you have paid for every processed , gray meat  excuse, of a pasty  and just smile.    Worth  working your way through the menu.",

I'm so boring I stuck with the original \"Shepard's pie\" and my husband/I shared the Sticky Toffee Pudding. Absolutely, delicious. The Pastis (Pastry) was just so warm, flaky, buttery tasting, and just melts in your mouth after each bite. I probably could just eat the pastry all by itself - it's so good. The meal entree, I think it was a huge size for one person to eat but, as the history goes it was for feeding the miners, Lol! I didn't think I would be able to finish my entree but, surprisingly I did. I was super stuffed though but, my kane (husband) wanted dessert - so crazy! So we shared the toffee pudding - ohhh so glad we did. The toffee cake came in a  cute little cast iron bowl with melted toffee all over and nice vanilla ice cream on the side - we both ate it so fast, we didn't even blink and puff - was gone! \nOur waitress was so nice and kept coming back to check in on us, filling up our waters, seeing how we were doing, and being amazing! Can't wait to go back again...Yummmy, I'm hungry already just writing about it! LoL",

ALL of them.  There are only a few of the veggie pasties I haven't tried.  Outside of the original and traditional ones, though, the Rosemary Chicken and the Pilgrim have to be my favorites.  There's no need for side dishes or appetizer breads or anything, since every delicious bite you need comes wrapped up neatly in an egg-brushed pastry pocket fresh out of the oven.  It's exactly the right amount of food.\n\nThe owner is an extremely friendly, knowledgeable, and cool fella, and he's always looking at ways to make his business better.  He's chosen a great crew to meet the increasing demands of this growing hot spot, since everyone who works there is nice and down-to-earth.  I've never seen a single employee lounging or wasting time there.\n\nWhat they do really, really well:  (1) All of the FOOD, including the salads and desserts.  (2) The beer selection is incredible, full of tasty imports and domestics both on tap and in bottles.  (3) The prices are excellent.  (4) The decor is sleek and modern, complete with classic rock playing at a quiet yet audible volume.\n\nWhat they could improve on:  There's very little room for parties of 4.  There's plenty of counter space, a handful of tables for 2, and a custom table for 3 that's kind of neat, but the small area at the back that used to be smaller tables is now one large table.  Parties of 4 now take up the whole area (that could seat up to 8), making it awkward for any other big parties coming in.  Plus, you can't cut through tables to sit on the bench side of the booth anymore.  You have to scoot down the length of the table and then push everyone out again if you have to get up for any reason.  (A very small fault, considering that everything else about the place is incredible!)\n\nOverall, this is one of Tempe's best little restaurants.  Whenever I'm not craving food from a particular location, pasties have become the default food for my whole household.  They're always tasty and we just never get tired of them.  I have to move out of state soon, and of all the places we've eaten in our 10 years here, I will miss the Cornish Pasty Company the most!!!",

For those of you who don't know what a pasty is, it's basically a baked pastry case filled with your choice of ingredients. Very much resembles a pie. Pasties are the only item on the menu but there are a wide variety of flavors. I had the Oggy, and it was enjoyable mostly because it was different than most foods I eat for lunch or have even tried before (and it seemed the most British). The ingredients are not amazing, but overall it was a good lunch. Dip your pasty in ketchup so it isn't so dry. \n\nPRICE: The pasties are kinda expensive for what you get. A pasty will run for about $8-9 without any sides. The pasties aren't very large, but will be enough for a lunch. \n\nSERVICE: We were served by a nice girl, and the lunch went very smoothly. \n\nATMOSPHERE: Very thin dining area. Only one table can sit 3 people, the rest are bar stools and 2 person tables. Didn't really seem British with the metal rock playing in the kitchen either.

Ever since my first visit, I have been hooked. I have learned to order one pasty for lunch, and get another to-go for later-- because knowing me, I will have a second craving during the day.\n\n  The first time I went I courageously tried their Chicken Tikka Masala pasty. My grandfather is from India, and I was raised on traditional Indian food, so I was a skeptic. However, their take on chicken masala (typically consisting of chicken, red curry, potatoes, vegetables and accompanied with rice) was impressive. There was just the right amount of curry to chicken to vegetable ratio, and I could not help but want to scarf it down. It was mild, so anyone could love it. Even their Vegetarian Tikka Masala pasty is delicious. As a former vegetarian and vegan, I am always skeptical when trying new meat substitutes, but the Quorn chicken substitute has a great consistency. \n \nAnother time I went, I tried their Shepherd's Pie Pasty, and declared that a victory. The pastry shell was crisp, the filling was flavorful, and the peas and carrots hadn't gone to mush. You can tell that they make the pasties (pastys?) fresh just by biting into them, but if you're not convinced, sit up at the bar and watch. \n\n  I will say, one of the best pasties they have is their Lovely Bit a Salmon. It took me a while to be able to order it because every time I tried, they were sold out (AND FOR GOOD REASONING!). I got lucky one unassuming Tuesday afternoon while ordering delivery for my mother, my roommate and myself. They were surprisingly prompt in their delivery and didn't seem to get lost with my crappy directions to my apartment. I ordered the Salmon, my mother the Pilgrim (SOOOO GOOD), and my roommate the Cheese Steak ( I didn't try his, but he said it was awesome). The Salmon pasty was heaven. I am not kidding- HEAVEN wrapped in a delicate pastry blanket and hand delivered from The Almighty Himself. The salmon was cooked to perfection, the dill sauce was mild, the asparagus still al dente, the potatoes were perfect, and the tomatoes and spinach were an added plus. \n\n My new favorite \"every-now-and-again\" pasty is The Peanut Butter and Jelly. HOLY GUACAMOLE! They have taken the traditional PB&J and slapped it in the face sent it home to it's momma. Then added some refinement, and some ooey-gooey, yummy in my tummy, goody-goody gumdrops to it. Holy Toledo. The banana is welcomed added bonus.  \n \nTo be honest, I have yet to try a pasty there that I do not like. This is a great thing, yet can be very unhelpful when trying to figure out what to have for lunch or dinner. \n\n Maybe someone can help me... I do not know what is in their salad dressing for their basic green salad... but it is AMAZING! \n Their garlic roasted potatoes and mushy peas are so yummy as well. \n\n They have my two drink requirements on tap: Guinness and Boddingtons. Also, they have Duvel which is one of my favorite Belgian beers for a moderate price. They have great Happy Hour drink specials including $3 car bombs. $3! YOU CAN'T BEAT THAT!\n\n Dine in, take out, or delivery. It doesn't matter how you get it, just GET IT! Make sure that if you order their green salad you get extra dressing--you will be happy that you did.",

The vegetables were cooked perfectly, as they were fresh and still a little crunchy. \n\nLiterally my only complaint about this place is that my meal was so good I kept trying to bite into it while it was still hot, burning my mouth multiple times. I look forward to coming back the next time I'm visiting my sis in Tempe, as I know she's about to jump on the Cornish Pastry Co regular train! She already has the \"Pilgrim\" pastie picked out as her next one to try and at about $9/meal, I bet she'll have worked through most of the menu by the time I see her again.\n\nDefinitely put this on your \"must see\" list of places to eat (for lunch)!",

The seating could be a bit more comfortable but the lighting and the hipster feel of the place is strangely calming. The menu is massive and surprisingly includes an entirely vegetarian section as well. I usually order the Mexican which comes with choice of vegetarian beef or regular. I decided to give vegetarian a try. I was certainly surprised. We ordered an appetizer of curried potatoes and baked beans and they were amazing. Finally we finished the meal with some beers and a desert of bread pudding. My one complaint is that they still don't have mushy peas. However, this is one of the few places that I insist on taking people new to the east valley.",

On another note, for any of you other vegetarians out there, I sat at the bar and could see the prep area where they cut the scrumptious pasties and prep them up to go out to customers, and to my satisfaction and delight, they were thoughtful enough to use a separate knife to cut my veggie pasty.

Absolutely nothing, I knew.\n\nBut then, today turned out to be a special day...\nI was trapped - back to back meetings from early morning through late afternoon with no time for lunch. Fortunately for me a good friend but obviously not as hardworking co-worker on her way out the door offered to bring me something back. Where was she going? Pasty!!! She just needed to know what I wanted, of course. So I checked the Pasty to go menu hanging from the bars of my cell - oops - I mean the wall of my cube, and to my surprise discovered that this wasn't going to be just another Pasty... Being the quasi-vegetarian I am, I've been slowly working my way through their vegetarian menu (more than 10 delicious options, including my favorite eggplant parmesan), and there was only one left - the Veggie Tikka Masala. My 11th and final vegetarian pasty - quite the momentous occasion, don't you think?\n\nIt was while I was savoring the perfect mix of fake chicken, bell pepper and basmati rice in tikka masala sauce wrapped in that soft chewy crust, dipped in that rich mint-yogurt dressing that I realized, 50 reviews be damned. Something new to say or not, I've got to say it. So for what's it's worth, this is it.\n\nSo, in conclusion: If you haven't been to Pasty yet, you need to go - soon. Come on, man - 50 reviews with a 4 1/2 star average rating? This place so obviously rocks! One tip: if you go for lunch, go early (they open at 11). It gets pretty busy and takes longer the later and busier it gets. Going early is also recommended if there are more than 2 in your party - there are only a couple of tables that fit 3 or more (otherwise you'll be sittin' at separate tables, or at the bar - oh, and should you find yourself headed for the bar, try not to sit directly in front of the one of the ovens, as those seats get pretty freakin' warm).",

I am not huge on mock meat so I tend to stick with the Cheese & Potato pasty. However, what I have had of the mock meat is pretty crazy good. The dipping sauces are delicious and the breading of the pasty is phenomenal. \n\nGreat place to fill up on drinks and grub at a fairly reasonable price (and if you think it's expensive - it's worth every last penny).",

A lot of people don't even know it's there. Its a super hip dark lit bar with comfy couches and a stage area that has some old church pews as tables setup. There is a couple pool tables and dart boards. They have live music sometimes and serve the whole Cornish menu. Its pretty much just another part of the same restaurant, but for us locals.

You cant go wrong with anything on the menu, and by now I've had almost everything!  My favorite of all time is the Chicken Greek and it amazes me with every bite!  What is a pasty you ask?  This is a common question, and I've never experienced them before I found this place or have really ever seen them anywhere else.  They are kind of like a calzone, but instead of the ingredients being encased in a pizza dough crust, it is more like a pie crust.  Super yummy!  And these are no ordinary pasties, they are gourmet pasties.  A close second to the Chicken Greek is the Spicy Asiago Chicken for me.  With around 38 different types of pasties, everyone can find something they will want to try, as well as an impressive vegetarian selection.  The ambiance is excellent too.  You really feel like you're in a European Pub and not tucked away in a random strip mall in Tempe.  The beer selection is very nice and the wait staff is always friendly and helpful.  This is a true pub atmosphere and is pretty dark inside and does get quite busy during peak hours.  Most of the inside seating are old church pews on each side of very long tables.  Several parties can comfortably sit at each of these tables, but there really isn't anything separating these long tables and pews, and there is potential for your small group to be \"invaded\" by a larger group moving in on that table.  I love the look of the church pews and dimly lit candle light that adds to the Gothic feel to the place though, and have only once felt a little \"taken over\" by a bigger group (was a Fri night) in all my years of coming here.  They have a very nice outside patio with more separated tables, which is an excellent option during the cooler times of the year here.  I remember when this was a teeny tiny little place serving amazing food and am very happy for the owner's success and their incredible expansion, not only to the neighboring suites at this location, but through out the valley and beyond!

With an incredible beer selection, nice and friendly wait staff, and incredible food, the Pasty is one of my favorite places in Tempe, hands down. \n\nTo start, get yourself one of the many awesome beers they have on tap. If you're planning on staying a while to enjoy the brand new patio (with heaters and misters), I would recommend getting an extra large glass. 32 ounces of fun. \n\nNext, go ahead and get yourself a cup of one of their awesome soups. Personal favorite: Red Pepper. Spicy, fresh, and delicious. If soup isn't your thing, I would recommend the oven chips -- oven-cooked french fries with cracked pepper. Definitely add the jalapeno. \n\nFor the main course, obviously a pasty is the way to go.

Clearly, I've been missing out!  \n\nThis place is a dark, dimly lit british pub-style restaurant.  It was completely slammed, with loads of mostly college aged people.  Everyone seemed to be laughing, talking, and having a genuinely good time.  We sat at the best seats in the house, the bar, and got to watch the staff work their magic. From there, you could see most of the kitchen work as well as the bar work.  Always fun, and the staff were plenty entertaining, ha ha.\n\nMy wife and I each tried a pasty to share, me the Oggie, and Stacy had the shepherds pie.  The Oggie is their traditional pasty, with steak, potatoes, onion and rutabaga (swede) with a side of red wine gravy or ketchup. So good!  I also tried some of my wife's, which was very good as well.  In addition, we split an order of the chips (fries).  The food took a while, but it's all made fresh and baked, and very much worth the wait.  It was cooked to perfection!\n\nWe had a GREAT experience here, and can't wait to go back.  Do yourself a favor and go check them out!",

A unique concept - at least I've never seen any other pasty restaurants around - makes this place truly one of a kind.\n\nI have two favorites when I'm there. 1. the Royale with cheese with a side of ranch. 2. the pilgrim with a side of red wine gravy.\nThe Royale with cheese is what you think it is - burger related. It's hamburger, cheese, onion, mushrooms bacon, and the best part - fries all snuggled into a flaky pasty crust. I like to dip mine into ranch for that classic burger tastiness.\nThe Pilgrim is thanksgiving dinner. It's turkey, sweet potatoes, stuffing and onions. Served with a side of cranberries and gravy. \nI always have a hard time choosing between the two because they are both so delicious. \n\nThe place itself has a cool, laid back vibe and the staff is always friendly.\n\nThe pasties do take a while to make though so expect to wait a while. These are not fast food in any sense of the term. If you are in a hurry, this is not the place for you. Especially at lunch.\n\nAlso, their seating is really best set up for groups of two.  This is not a \"take the whole family out for dinner\" kinda place. They have a couple tables in the back that can seat four but the majority of tables are two-tops and then there is space at the bar.\n\nNo question, Cornish Pasty Company is one of my favorite places in the valley.",

I would suggest to call ahead and order before eating there. I can understand the high price for just one pasty (around $9 per pastey not including a side) because they make each one by hand with fresh ingredients. The restaurant can work on the interior design as its a bit confusing, a mix between modern and old style English pub.

            "text": "Dating back hundreds of years, the Cornish pasty comes from humble beginnings. The half moon shaped baked pastry filled with meat and vegetables was designed as a lunch for soot-covered Cornish tin miners. To eat it, miners would hold the pasty at the crimped edge, and then discard that part after eating the rest of the pasty. This way the miners didn't eat the dirt they were covered in, missing out on ingesting stuff like arsenic that was common in the mines. While most tin mining is gone, we're fortunate to have the Cornish Pasty Co., which specializes in pasties.\n\nWith restaurants in Tempe and Mesa, each location has its own spirit. While both are laid back, the Tempe location has a more subdued feel with dim lighting and no windows. Mesa has a brighter interior with indie rock blaring over the sound system.\n\nIf you enjoy watching kitchen action, belly up to the bar at either locale for a first-hand look into the hard work that goes into making their delicious pasties.\n\nAs soon as I entered the Tempe location, the warm smell of wine gravy and fresh baked crust covered me like a blanket of mouth-watering comfort. The feeling was like going home for the holidays. I know it's a million degrees outside, but the feeling transcends the summer heat.\n\nThe first pasty I tried, The Pilgrim ($8), exemplified everything that tastes good at Thanksgiving, luscious turkey breast, sweet potatoes, stuffing and grilled onions all wrapped in a tender crust, then served with a side of cranberry sauce. After one bite, I felt like I needed to pay thanks to someone.\n\nThe Porky ($7) is filled with all that is good: pork, apples, potatoes, onions and sage and served with a side of red wine gravy. The problem with the gravy is that it's so tasty I'm not sure whether to dunk my pasty into it or drink it.\n\nNever able to resist a good burger, I decided to take a chance with the Royale with Cheese ($7.50). Ordered medium, this pasty was brimming with a juicy hamburger, French fries and cheese and served with a side of Thousand Island dressing. As the meat juices ran down my face, I couldn't help but think of the scene in Pulp Fiction where John Travolta explains to Samuel Jackson what the name of a Quarter Pounder with Cheese is in Amsterdam.\n\nThe Peanut Butter and Jelly ($5) was served piping hot. One bite of this was not going to be enough. Filled with creamy peanut butter, raspberry preserves and sliced banana, the sweet goodness oozed out after the first cut was made. The plate was expertly cleaned in mere moments.\n\nCornish Pasty Co. has a small, but great, beer selection, including one of my favorites, Kronenbourg 1664. Plus visit during their daily happy hour from 3-5pm and you'll enjoy a buck off of every pint.",

I'd say they were a bit slow and not as attentive as I'd like but its more of a pub feel and they were pretty busy anyway. We ordered the Crispin hard ale to share and it was pretty tasty, not very sweet. I like how they have a large selection international beers (like King Fisher from India!) on their menu, its like you really are in an English pub!\n\nOur group got the Porky, Rosemary chicken, Lamb vindaloo, and chicken tikka masala pasties. We also ordered the broccoli and cauliflower bake and banana dessert. They were all good but I loved my lamb vindaloo, it was like actual lamb vindaloo that you would get at an Indian restaurant! Ironically the chicken tikka was my least favorite because it was too tomato-ey but it wasn't terrible. The yogurt sauce that came with complemented the pasty perfectly. \n\nThe broccoli cauliflower bake was delicious and cheesy, totally hit the spot on a cold night! The banoffe banana dessert was ok but I was disappointed that it was mostly whipped cream (unsweetened). The caramel, graham cracker crust and sliced bananas were still enough to carry on the dish. \n\nOverall great food, fun casual atmosphere ( saw LOTS of people on dates here) and totally worth checking out if you're in Tempe!",

It was like an awesome burrito but with a flaky crust and WAY more choices.  When I lived in Tempe I was a terribly picky eater and every single time I came in I got the same thing, the meatball pasty.  It was awesome, everytime.  Everything on the menu looks delicious and it looks like the flavors blend together very well.  They are premade before you get there, so you cant really have them take ingredients out, although I am sure if you let them know ahead of time it can be arranged.\n\nSo there are 2 things I would like to talk about here.  First, the atmosphere.  Walking in you have a tiny restaurant that has a bar on one side and some small tables against the wall.  All the waiters are tatted up and lend an air of ruggedness to the joint.  As you sit at the bar, they are right in front of you rolling up the pasties and behind them are the stoves that they bake your pies in after you order them.  So basically you are sitting at a bar, drinking a cold beer and you can feel the heat from the ovens.  In some places this would be annoying, but again I feel like it lends greatness to the atmosphere.  The music is usually some good British rock and once again, yes, lends to the atmosphere.  So I enjoy feeling like I am in some tiny pub in Cornwall.\n\nSecond, THE DESSERT!  I will start with the Strawberry Pavlova which I could have done without.  The meringue shell is light and unless that is your cup of tea, keep on reading.  The PB&J pasty I only had one time and it was good, but second rate for me compared to the next two items.  Next up is the caramel apple pasty.  Delish!  Apple and caramel baked into the pie shell and topped with ice cream.  However nothing in this world can touch the BANOFFEE Pie!  Dig this real quick, a thick graham cracker pie crust.  Top that with caramel.  Top that with whipped cream and top that with bananas.  Oh, and if you are crazy ask them for strawberries too...and ice cream.  Now eat that and tell me you've had a better dessert.  I sure as hell havent!",

We went to the Tempe location which is a lot farther away from home than the Mesa location.   But that doesn't matter because the drive is always worth it.  I like this location because it is the original.  \nThis time I decided to skip the appetizer to save room for dessert.  I still had the usual very large Hoegaarden to start and ordered the very new and not on the menu \"Spicy BBQ Chicken Pasty\". Anything with spicy and BBQ deserves a shot and it was delicious.  \nThe chicken was tender and juicy, the BBQ sauce had some kick to it, the jalapeño and grilled onions were a great touch.  I am not sure yet if this may be a new favorite but if it weren't, it would be a close second.  Only one thing could make this night more perfect....well....maybe two things but I will settle for the Banoffee pie.\nIt has been a while since I had the Banoffee pie and I don't know why.  Who doesn't love graham cracker crust, homemade caramel, bananas and fresh whipped cream?  With every spoon full you get everything, the crust is incredible, the caramel is sweet, the whipped cream is delicious and the bananas are perfect.  I was only able to eat half of it so I brought the other half home with me.\nAnother perfect meal from a great place to eat, drink and be satisfied....anywho.  I know it's 7 am but I am heading to the refrigerator for the other half of my Banoffee pie.",

So much so that after eating there one night, we returned the night after for another round!\n\nWe sampled quite a few things from their menu...the Royale with Cheese was badass, the Chicken Alfredo pleasant, the Cajun wickedly delicious and spicy...and don't forget the Pilgrim, which is like having Thanksgiving bundled up and delivered to you in a wonderfully delicious pasty package.  AND the portions are big enough that you can eat half and be full, so the goodness can be enjoyed as a heated up lunch the next day!  BUT WAIT, THERE IS MORE!  We couldn't resist dessert...\n\nNight One:  Banoffee Pie.  Thick layer of graham cracker, wickedly thick layer of RICH caramel, a spattering of banana slices and then fresh whipped cream.  FREAKIN AWESOME.\n\nAND IT GETS EVEN BETTER!!!!\n\nNight Two:  Peanut Butter and Jelly Pasty.  Imagine amazing pastry smothered in chunky peanut butter, drizzled with raspberry jelly and encasing bananas...now top that with some more pastry, more jelly and whipped cream...not the sickening sweet shit that comes in cans...fresh, cool awesomeness disguised as a white blob.

            "text": "This was my second time in Phoenix and since we were staying around the Tempe area I could not let the opportunity pass us by of not trying the most Yelped place in all of Phoenix! I've never had a pasty before so I didn't know what to expect but judging from the pictures I had a general idea of what it would taste it. We came in fairly late around 10pm and since I was going to run the Arizona 1/2 marathon the following morning I opted for one of the lighter dishes. They truly have a wide variety of what would go in your pasty from burger, to Alfredo to even Indian chicken tikka masala. I ordered the salmon one, which I did enjoy. The crust went perfectly with the well cooked salmon. There was also spinach with dill sauce and other things that I can't remember. If I was feeling adventurous and didn't have to worry about eating light I would of ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala since our server said that was one of her favorites. Although we had no room for dessert we ordered a banoffee pie to go. This was really tasty as well great combination of bananas, gram cracker, whipped cream and caramel. From that Yelp picture the caption says it's Banana Cream pie, don't make the mistake of asking for it because our server corrected us and told us it was Banofee pie, haha! The inside of this place is a hybrid between a dive and a pub because it was dark and had community style tables. Our server was pretty good I guess but nothing memorable in terms of outstanding customer service. I can see why this is a popular spot among ASU students. Most if not all the pasty selections are less than $10. Even half a pasty is filling so you could even share one. Pasty places aren't too popular so I would definitely recommend trying them out. I don't know when I'll be in Phoenix again, but if I'm in the Tempe area I will definitely stop by.",

Hardy Dr. \n\nUpon entering, my eyes had to adjust to the extremely dark lighting and interior. There are several entrances to the place so you might have to walk around a bit to get to the main dining area. We walked through the bar area (which smelled like a college pub) to arrive at the main dining area which was fairly empty. There was only one other table occupied besides ours and a couple patrons at the bar. After, we were at a loss of what to do as no one directed us towards a table or told us to seat ourselves. Finally, we asked the chef and he said you can grab any table you want. My friend went up to get menus herself and we perused for several minutes before our waitress arrived. She was helpful in taking our order but she certainly took her time in attending to us and serving our food. Which was confusing to me as there was only one other table she had to attend to. \n\nWhen I asked her what the red wine gravy was made of, she was confused by my question and did not answer correctly. She did state that the alcohol evaporates however I could clearly taste it when I ate it with my pasty. \n\nThis place's only saving grace was its food. I ordered the Oggie pasty which was wonderful except the meat tasted slightly undercooked. My friends all loved their pasties and the flavors came together beautifully. \n\nThey did split the check between four credit cards.\n\nOverall, I would not come back, nor would I recommend this place to others.

Two of us got soft drinks (soda + root beer), and they were FLAT. As in nary a bubble to be seen flat.  We told the waitress, and it was about 10 minutes later with some fresh bubbly sodas.\n\nDid I mention they were out of a ton of things? We eventually ended up with potato wedges (out of the fries), lamb pasty, thanksgiving pasty, leak + potato soup, and english toffee pudding. Why do establishments think it's cute to rename products which already have a perfectly acceptable name (I'm looking at you, starbucks)? \n\nBefore the food could come out, they seated a party of 7 LARGE individuals at our communal bench. We are a party of 4 normal to slender individuals, but the amount of human flesh pushed up to us was ridiculous.  There's personal space, and then there's hello, you are practically in my lap!

We sat at the bar in front of the kitchen and the guys doing the cooking were very cool as a matter of fact everybody working there was very cool and willing to go the extra step for example are waiter was telling us about the beer they had on tap and we were trying to decide so he brought us a couple of samples without us asking-nice. As I said the guys doing the cooking and prep were more than willing to talk to us telling us about the different dishes even though they were very busy.\n \nI ordered the 'bangers and mash' while my wife had the salmon both were very very good and for dessert we had the chocolate baked bread {that might not be the exact name but its close} good god it was soo damn good! Next time I'm getting one to take home.\n\nWe're going back with our neighbours this week and I can't wait!\n\nIf I could give 6 stars I would! Really great food and excellent people!\n\nPS we went to the one on Alma School in Mesa.",

            "text": "The first time I ever had a pasty was in Michigan when I was 10 years old. My grandparents bought them at the grocery store premade - all we had to do was warm them up in the oven. When Cornish Pasty Co. announced they were going to open in Tempe back in 2005, I was ecstatic and for good reasons - it was love at first bite. \n\nSince 2005, I've tried many different pasties and still can't decide which my favorite is. The Oggie is a good standard- it's what my memory from Michigan tastes like only better. The Pilgrim is amazing - but only when made with Turkey. Honestly, my favorite part is the crust that holds the goodies. I don't care what is inside, as long as that crust is flakey and warm. Mmm... One time I ordered a small Greek Salad and now I have to order it every time I'm there. The dressing they use is this lemony pesto and it is so, so good... the only down side is that I'm still tasting it hours later. It's that strong! To finish up, you have got to order the chocolate bread pudding with crème angelias AND ice cream. The bread is deliciously chocolately but it is also soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside, which I love. The husband isn't too crazy about it (\"bread pudding shouldn't be crunchy!\"), but that means more for me!\n\nThey have happy hour starting at 3pm, which includes drink specials. I've only ordered a Gin and Tonic here and as far as I'm concerned, it's pretty damn good. One time they were out of tonic and they made a special trip to go out and buy some, just so I could have my drink. I felt pretty special that night.\n\nWe have been to the location in Mesa and the patio is really nice, but the original restaurant has rustic charm. Whether you are sitting at the bar top or in a corner booth, you can feel the energy of the restaurant and be intimate with your dining partner. It's nice they expanded the restaurant and were still able to keep the same ambiance. \n\nAnytime we are in Tempe, this is always one of our stops and a place we frequently take friends. If you are ever in the area, definitely stop in!!",

            "text": "Apparently hailing from the British city of Cornwall and here in Arizona finding its foothold at the appropriately named Cornish Pasty Company I had originally heard of the pasty during a recent trip to Philadelphia where the baked crescent was a daily special on the menu at The Dandelion but featuring the least the combination of beef, rutabaga, onion, and potato I cannot really say my interest as high - a situation remedied by the extensive (if inauthentic selection at Cornish Pasty Company and thus leading me through their doors just after 2:30pm where I'd find the small bar area still full but the larger dining room only perhaps half so.\n\nLargely unaware of the logistics of CPC - whether you seat yourself or wait to be seated and whether you order at the counter or at a table I stood and watched for a moment before deciding to seat myself and within moments a friendly young woman named Hannah greeted me, first offering a beverage - just water - and subsequently the restaurant's extensive menu which I browsed at length while listening to The Sex Pistols and then The Clash play overhead.  An eclectic list of Pasty's both 'traditional,' 'signature,' and 'premium' plus a collection of soups, salads, and sides I asked Hannah about portions on her return and told that each pasty clocked in at approximately a pound (and that two would be \"way too much\" food for a solo diner since she could only eat half of one) thus leading me to settle on a single option, a dish I was told would take \"about fifteen minutes,\" leaving me more time to study and enjoy the tunes - the White Stripes perhaps the only thing 'un-British' in a string of songs ranging from Zeppelin to The Beatles to The Ramones.\n\nReading as I waited and enjoying the room as well as watching the team slice meat, shape dough, and chop vegetables it would be just under a quarter hour before my dish arrived and although smaller than I'd imagined (I definitely could have eaten two - probably three if I didn't have dessert and dinner plans) the Shepherd's Pie that was presented was far better than I'd have ever expected, a golden buttery shell wrapped around lightly mint tinged lamb and although fatty and intense nicely balanced by the vegetables.  Generally a fan of Shepherd's Pie, particularly when using a sharp cheddar, this handheld version would prove to be an exemplary take on the classic and the addition of a sidecar of onion and sage laden red wine gravy certainly did not hurt.\n\nDebating a second pasty as Hannah returned to check in on me (The Pilgrim sounds quite good) but subsequently turning my attention to the sweeter half of the menu I decided to not make the same mistake twice and inquiring as to which dessert she recommended I went with my gut and ordered two to arrive with a delay between them, the first \"Shirley Temple's Pudding,\" a $6 sticky toffee pudding served in a cast iron pot with a side of crème anglaise.  Rich and thick, a dark treacle just barely set at the center and almost a brownie consistency along the edges what really shined about this dish was the manner in which it worked with the crème, a thick but delicate sauce balancing out the intense sweetness of the pudding.\n\nMoving next to my second dessert, and for my tastes the better of the two, a goodly delay of fifteen minutes brought to the table Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding with vanilla ice cream - a truly unique spin on bread pudding made with what almost seemed to be cracker-thin pieces of bread juxtaposing a brandy tinged chocolate sauce and baked much like the sticky toffee pudding to be set at the edges yet dense and moist at the center.  Truly a decadent dessert - the sort begging for a glass of milk or coffee - I will say that the ice cream was rather run-of-the-mill vanilla and although it served its purpose admirably I'd definitely go with more anglaise on subsequent visits - visits which I'm sure will happen the next time I find myself drawn back to Tempe, or to Mesa where there is apparently a second location whose Banoffee Pie and Apple Caramel Pasties seem to be calling.",

I'm also thankful that they have so many vegetarian choices, seeing how I've noticed that many restaurants in the Valley rely way too much on meat products.

It has gotten so bad that, after last night, I am afraid to say that I do not plan on returning to this restaurant again.\n\nI live right down the street from Cornish Pasty Co., and have dined in and gotten carry-out whenever I could convince my boyfriend to go for their food (he apparently doesn't crave their pasty selection as much as I do).  We've sat at the bar and it's been decent service, but when ordering carry-out and dining in the restaurant, I've noticed service worsening, and becoming rude and dismissive.  \n\nTo begin with, there is no signage upon entering the restaurant, so you just have to know whether or not to seat yourself or go to the back to pick up a carryout order.

The last time I went to pick up carry out, I was summarily ignored by at least three servers before butting in on one of their conversations to state that I was there to pick up an order.

After standing in the doorway for about a minute (we couldn't remember if we could just seat ourselves or not), a server acknowledged us in a friendly manner and invited us to sit anywhere.  After choosing a seat, we waited over five minutes (during this time tracking down our own menus and beer lists), while 2 different bussers walked past us twice, and 3 different servers walked past our area.  During this time, no one acknowledged us, no busser brought us water (despite walking straight past our area with a water pitcher).  After a busser brought water to a group that had literally just sat down, we decided to just leave.  My boyfriend informed the manager of the poor service on our way out, and the manager was polite, but did not offer to rectify the situation in any manner.\n\nI understand that all places have bad nights, but as I said, this has been a trend that we have noticed over the last year (maybe their expansion stressed the quality of service?), and we do not care to spend our hard-earned money at a place where we are ignored and apparently invisible every time we have gone there in the recent past; plus, their food is good, but not good enough to put up with sub-par service.

During this time, no one acknowledged us, no busser brought us water (despite walking straight past our area with a water pitcher).  After a busser brought water to a group that had literally just sat down, we decided to just leave.  My boyfriend informed the manager of the poor service on our way out, and the manager was polite, but did not offer to rectify the situation in any manner.\n\nI understand that all places have bad nights, but as I said, this has been a trend that we have noticed over the last year (maybe their expansion stressed the quality of service?), and we do not care to spend our hard-earned money at a place where we are ignored and apparently invisible every time we have gone there in the recent past; plus, their food is good, but not good enough to put up with sub-par service.  We'd much rather go to one of the restaurants in downtown Phoenix that has fantastic service and better food, which is what we did last night.",

It's in an odd location at a strip-mall that's tucked around the corner from a decent Mexican restaurant and a sub-shop.  \n\nI'm not sure if they're going for the feel of a mineshaft, but it was ridiculously cold in there.  I'm all for beating the heat, but to go from 104 to 62 degrees was a little much for me.  \n\nI could talk more about the ambiance, which is mildly interesting, but the food is the most important thing.  I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala (Red curry) which had chicken, potato, and the red curry sauce.  The chicken was dry, as well as the curry sauce.  Mere days before I'd had Chicken red curry at George and Dragon in Phoenix, which was really good.  The pasty was not on par with that.  I have to say it was one of the more bland curries I've ever had.  Perhaps I should have tried something like their Bangers and Mash or Shepherd's Pie.\n\nAs for the price, everything on the menu should cost about 20% less.  I think Cornish Pasty is WAY overpriced.  Some of the more traditional stuff is $7 to $7.50, while everything else is $8-9.  Beer is also a little on the pricey side (20 ounce drafts are $5-6) for this kind of place.  Two Boddington's and a pasty were $18 before tax and tip.  So if you absolutely have to have a pasty then I guess this is your place, otherwise there are some other fabulous places nearby that won't break the bank.",

At the end of the 3rd day, I had seen enough food to feed the LSU National champion football team.  I could out fast Les or Bear on their survivor shows\n\nDinner time was approaching.....My business associate and I couldn't face a full course dinner for at least another 24 hours...but we knew we had to eat something so we wouldnt wake up at 3 am famished.  I remembers reading about this place in Yelp that would be perfect for our situation....so remembering some favorable Yelp reviews in Phoenix  I said to him:\n\n\"How about pastys for dinner?\"\n\nHe went from a relaxed and carefree disposition to a stunned and shocked demeanor.   He looked me like I was from another planet and his glance indicated doubt about my integrity.   Then with a delayed but dry smile he spoke up and said....\n\n\"Aren't those things they wear at the.....\"\n\n\"NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!    Not pasties......pastys.\"   I retorted quickly before the people in the lobby heard the next nouns he was just about to utter.   \"Pasty's with a short vowel, not long.   Have you ever had one.?\"\n\nStill thinking of the long vowel version, he hesitated a little and answered with a \"No\" veiled with a lot of doubt and concern.\n\n\"Good.   That's where we're going.\"    As I glanced over to him, I could see a sense of curiousity, dispair and expectation of upcoming chaos.\n\nWe arrived at 7:45 pm.   It's dark everywhere.   In the street, in the parking lot.   We enter the restaurant and it's no brighter.   \n\nIt is a very narrow and long restaurant with just enough room for seats at the bar nearly the length of the store and small side tables on the side.  The interior decoration theme is obvious here.   Build the biggest bar that would fit in this row house type of store, and accessorize the rest of the restaurant around the bar.  \n\nSitting in a very dark restaurant, with Beatle music blaring away, this English pub type of place had a huge variety of pastys....from traditional steak and potatoes, to bangers and mash, to more contempory selections that include vegetarian, curries, and fish.   They have a huge selection of international beers, many of which are of the UK......duhhh.\n\nI wanted to eat \"light\" so I selected the Lovely Bit a Salmon which is\nAtlantic Salmon in a white wine cream & dill sauce, sauted asparagus, spinach, roasted red potatoes, spinach and roasted tomatoes. \n\nWHAT A GREAT DISH.   Everything was layered carefully inside the pasty which was served cut in half.  The salmon was cooked perfectly.  The asparagus was not over cooked but had a crunch.   All the flavors blended well together.   I still wasn't hungry so I took one half of it back to the hotel....and had it for breakfast the following morning......which tasted just great.\n\nMy buddy had Spicy Asiago Chicken which was spicy chicken, roasted corn, black beans, asiago cheese, hatch chilies, and Mexican stewed tomatoes with a side of sour cream & salsa.   That too was excellent.\n\nIf ever in Phoenix, this would be worth any drive to have lunch or dinner and a beer.\n\nAfter dinner I asked him if he would return to eat here and he said he readily would.    Then I detected a slight pause and a curl of a smile in the background.........maybe he was fantasizing buying a long vowel...",

Both were extremely delicious and flavorful, and I loved the sauces that came with them.  I would definitely recommend getting different pasties so you can split them up and share them.

The Tempe location is tucked in the corner of a dingy mall far out of the Mill Ave nightlife.  There is barely a sign on the building, the windows are painted dark black with an old photo mural theme, the door leads into a narrow black corridor with no greeter.  It looks like a bar with a few 2-person tables and that's all ... until you accidentally discover that the bar (with barstools) is actually a \"kitchen\" with no alcohol and that if you wend your way around the end of the bar, passing the restrooms, you will find the actual dining room and drinking bar.  We ate in the kitchen/bar and only later happened upon that discovery and that there is second equally dark and foreboding door that goes to the main dining room.\n\nThe employees seemed to all guys, with a distinct aura of all being bikers, but they were super-friendly and acceptably attentive.  Assuming the food is made from scratch, the 20 - 30 minute wait to be served was also acceptable.  You can pass the time enjoying an excellent selection of draft and bottled beers.\n\nAt $6.50, my Oggie pasty was a good value.  The crust was tender and flakey and the meat was tasty.  I learned from this my first experience with rutabaga that I am not a fan of rutabaga, but that's not their fault. The amount of filling was roughly what you get in one of those tiny 99 cent pot pies in the frozen food section of the supermarket.  The brown-wine gravy was yummy.\n\nThe place sends a confusing message. It absolutely looks like a college dive (and I probably would be there all the time if I attended ASU) but it's quite a hike from campus. It's not Scottsdale funky (yea!!), and if you are wearing anything fancier than a tee shirt and jeans you would definitely feel out of place.  It's a curiously quiet place, none of the ribaldry you would find at an Irish pub (the canned music was mostly soft rock of the 70's and 80's).\n\nBottom line - it's rare to find a good pasty in this area, and these are good.  As the rating states, it's A-OK.",

I ordered the lamb vindaloo pasty, a cup of leek and potato soup, and the Shirley Temple pudding. The person taking my order said the order would be ready in 20 minutes so 21 minutes later I was parking my car and heading in to pick up my food. \n\nGetting into the restaurant was a little confusing. I chose the door that had the restaurant name on it, but once I entered, it appeared that I came through a back entrance behind the bar area. I made my way around to what I'd consider the front of the restaurant and was guided to the pick up area. The guys were friendly and my food was ready however they had my food on a plate and not prepared for take out. I had a seat while they got it together.\n\nI'd say my pasty was very rich, spicy and flavorful.  I'm used to pepper so I'm guessing it may be too spicy for some. The pasty was full of meat and I didn't feel slighted in the least. The soup was great, would order it again, however, they put it in a styrofoam drinking cup covered with foil, not very travel friendly.",

I could drink that delicious concoction by the gallon. \n\nThe vegetarian pasties are undeniably good as well, the Eggplant Parmesan is a worldly experience that I could eat any time, any day. It stuffs the best bits of the garden into a mozzarella, marinara and Parmesan wrapped envelope of goodness that has to be tasted to be appreciated.\n\nThe Cream of Leek, Potato and Stilton Cheese soup is out of this world, the Garlic & Herb Roasted Red Mashed Potatoes with Cheese make all other mashed potato dishes taste like dehydrated flake garbage, and the desserts (if you can find any more room in your belly for awesome) are the food of gods. The PB&J Pasty or the Banoffee Pie make me want to live in this restaurant until the day I die.\n\nThe location is being renovated currently to expand into the adjacent building, which is a welcomed change as the intimate dining area admittedly cramped on busy days. Though it is a wondrous experience to watch the staff prepare their pasties mere feet from your seat, it will really do well to have a few more tables. Sit at the bar if at all possible for the best dining experience.\n\nI wish I could give CPC 6 stars simply because the other places I've deemed worthy of 5 stars simply cannot compare. On top of all this, the unparalleled drinking specials, 32 oz steins, and $3 car bombs every day make this not only a wonderful place to eat, but a perfect spot to pickle the liver as well.",

The music they were playing was also very appeasing.\n\nMonday night, Hubzilla and I were looking for ADVENTURE!, completely exhausted with the usual suspects that we pick up for take out, we headed down to the college town affectionately known as \"Tempe\" and whipped out the handy dandy Yelp App.  Up jumps \"Cornish Pasty Company\" at the top of the list.  Eventually we found it tucked into the back of a strip mall (weirdly unexpected location...but sooooo glad we didn't turn away).  \n\nDown to brass tacks:\n\nThe menu has a bunch of stuff on it, yummy-sounding stuff, inexpensive stuff...After a brief conference with our server (and a couple of car bombs to lubricate our speaking skills) we decided to split The Oggie and The Peppered Steak.  \n\nThe Oggie was the favorite because once you added that red wine gravy to it, the flavors just kinda...pop. \n\nThe Peppered Steak, by default, was the 2nd favorite, but was also very yummy. I just wish that the peppercorn brandy cream sauce that came with it wasn't cold. Some people really like that, I guess, but I'm a warm-to-room-temperature-or-hotter saucy kinda chick. \n\nNext time, I look forward to tackling their delicious sounding dessert menu (they have creme anglaise!!!). I REALLY look forward to going back (soon) to try more pasties!",

If you don't know what that is then think about as...[moan]...a Hot Pocket.\n\nAs far as the pasties go, the Lamb Vindaloo is my favorite. I've also tried The Chicken Greek (least favorite), Chicken Tikka Masala, Lovely Bit a Salmon, and the Peppered Steak. They also have a good selection of vegetarian pasties even though I have yet to try them.\n\nThis place has expanded and added a lot more space on the other side, but, in my opinion, lost a bit of charm. Something about being uncomfortably hot near the ovens on a summer day in a somewhat cramped setting equals pure character, and I do miss it. Unless I'm hungry.\n\nThe staff is laid-back and pretty cool reminding me of dives in Austin, Charlotte, and Philly.\n\nIf you want, you can get the pasties half-baked so you can take them home and pop them in a 425-degree oven for 15-20 minutes. But why deprive yourself the experience of enjoying it here?",

Salmon, potatoes, asparagus... delicious!\n-Lamb Vindaloo, Lamb in red curry and potatoes... was decent, though I probably wouldn't get it again.  \n-Peppered Steak = GROSS, disgusting, worst thing I've ever received in any food making establishment.  I actually think mine was bad or rotten, and would've complained, but I'd taken it to go and so I was stuck with it.  I took one bite, gagged, spit it out, and threw it away.\n\nIf it weren't for the rotten peppered steak I received, I was going to give a 5-star review, but after it I think I'm being very forgiving with giving 4-stars.  Everything else was pretty excellent, so I'll try to forgive the one absolutely disgusting pasty.",

Simply put, the pasty is the premium version of an empanada....and a super deluxe version of a hot pocket.  \n\nThe boy and I drove here Saturday night around 8:30. The place was packed, and we waited about 15 minutes for a place to sit.  We were, as many others have mentioned, confused about where to go to get seated. A guy beyond the counter told us to just find an empty table to sit. I tried his technique and was stopped by another guy who told us to wait, and he'll get us a table.  \n\nI asked our server to see what's the most popular pasty, and he said there is one single pasty that sells more than the other.  So I would just suggest go with what you're feeling for the day.  I ended up with The Royales with Cheese, and my boy got the Bangers and Mash.  The Royales is basically a cheeseburger stuck inside the delicious, warm, buttery crust.  It had a weird garlic taste to it, which I didn't care for. The thousand island that came with on the side didn't go well with my pasty.  I still garbled that thing up regardless though.  I tried a piece of the Bangers and Mash, and I'm not a fan of it. I don't normally like eating pork, so I wouldn't have ordered this.  The boy really enjoyed it though.  \n\nNow, unto the BEST part of the meal...this is none other than their Banoffe Pie.  I HAD to get this even though I was already stuffed.  I have never had anything like this. Thick, crispy graham with creamy, homemade caramel, topped with whipped cream and slices of banana.  I've got a sweet tooth, and that banoffe was definitely one of the best desserts I have ever had!  I would definitely come back to this place again and again the next time I'm back in Arizona.",

What I got was a good hot pocket full of chicken and some sauce. Not nearly has juicy and spicy as I had imagined it would be, but still good. I chose the peanut butter and jelly pasty for a dessert to take home with me. When I got home and baked it, I took a bite and it was peanut butter and apple jelly? I was confused. It was ok.\n\nOn my second trip to CPC, I had the cheeseburger pasty. That was pretty darn good!

Clearly, I've been missing out!  \n\nThis place is a dark, dimly lit british pub-style restaurant.  It was completely slammed, with loads of mostly college aged people.  Everyone seemed to be laughing, talking, and having a genuinely good time.  We sat at the best seats in the house, the bar, and got to watch the staff work their magic. From there, you could see most of the kitchen work as well as the bar work.  Always fun, and the staff were plenty entertaining, ha ha.\n\nMy wife and I each tried a pasty to share, me the Oggie, and Stacy had the shepherds pie.  The Oggie is their traditional pasty, with steak, potatoes, onion and rutabaga (swede) with a side of red wine gravy or ketchup. So good!  I also tried some of my wife's, which was very good as well.  In addition, we split an order of the chips (fries).  The food took a while, but it's all made fresh and baked, and very much worth the wait.  It was cooked to perfection!\n\nWe had a GREAT experience here, and can't wait to go back.  Do yourself a favor and go check them out!",

Having close friends that have been eating pasties since before Christ was born + hanging around said friends for 20 years = a small history with pasties.\n\nI recently heard about this place on Yelp and every time I saw the name, I managed to over and over mis-read it as pastry.  My only defense is that I keep getting those forwards from folks that say it doesn't matter the order of the letters or even if all of them are there, you're brain will figure it out anyway.  i guess this time my brain figured wrong.  I digress...\n\nIt never occurred to me that this little known dish would have it's own establishment run in its honor.  Of course, once I finally clued in that it was pasty and not pastry and stopped acting like someone hopped up on pills, I naturally invited my pasty-lovin' friends to share in the experience.  They too were elated at the variety of pasty options and the fact this was the restaurant's purpose and specialty.  An added bonus is how f'n cheap it is.  Talk about a steal!\n\nThis place was packed!  Someone said to get there before 8 or 830, but it was 7 and overflowin'.  We managed to fit 5 of us in the awkward geometrical booth built for 3.  My two pasty veterans ordered the Oggie with ketchup since that's what they grew up on (minus the rutabaga).  They both liked it, but thought it was a little spicy due to the rutabaga and the fact they are both ridiculously sensitive to spice induced heat.  One of their sig others ordered a chicken pasty of some sort which he thought was just okay.  The other +1 and I had the shepherd's pie and there wasn't a crumb to be found on either plate.  \n\nOur waitress seemed completely unfriendly and a little standoff-ish.    She warmed up as the meal progressed, chatted with us, and she ended up being a great waitress.  One of the guys drinks diet coke like he's in some sort of contest.  After he downed the first one in record time and the waitress gave him a curious \"you need a refill already\" look, he warned her that he drinks a lot of diet coke and will be gettin' a lot of refills.  About two minutes later she came back with a pitcher so he could refill till his thirst is content.  Rock star move on her part.  We all left full, happy, and ready for the next phase of the evening.\n\nI'll definitely be back again - maybe even for lunch since I work relatively close.  Just remember pasty, not pastry.  Yum!",

For those of you who don't know what a pasty is, it's basically a baked pastry case filled with your choice of ingredients. Very much resembles a pie. Pasties are the only item on the menu but there are a wide variety of flavors. I had the Oggy, and it was enjoyable mostly because it was different than most foods I eat for lunch or have even tried before (and it seemed the most British). The ingredients are not amazing, but overall it was a good lunch. Dip your pasty in ketchup so it isn't so dry. \n\nPRICE: The pasties are kinda expensive for what you get. A pasty will run for about $8-9 without any sides. The pasties aren't very large, but will be enough for a lunch. \n\nSERVICE: We were served by a nice girl, and the lunch went very smoothly. \n\nATMOSPHERE: Very thin dining area. Only one table can sit 3 people, the rest are bar stools and 2 person tables. Didn't really seem British with the metal rock playing in the kitchen either. Maybe if it was the Sex Pistols...\n\nSKINNY: Cornish Pasty is great lunch spot at best, but doesn't offer anything that will blow your socks off. Interesting food with decent taste. I'll probably be going back.",

One guy even tripped over a hidden step that was sticking out from a sofa. Yes we laughed and made fun of him. The place has a bit of a dive bar feel. Just what I like. The music selection was excellent, deep cuts both modern and old. Loud enough to listen too but still hold a conversation. In this back room it was bar service only meaning we had no waitstaff. The people behind the bar were talkative, friendly, entertaining and very efficient. The menu is filled with a number of exotic pasty fillings, unlike the ground burger ketchup and potato mixture mom used to make. Nope, this is the real deal and ranges from chicken pot pie to salmon. The food was excellent, the beers were big, local and cold.  My only complaint is that the back room temperature was hotter than hell. Overall a very good experience.",

After hearing so many locals rave about the famous pastry, I had to pay the Cornish Pastry Company a visit. Talk about a British pub. This place mimics the dark, mysterious alley pubs in England. The restaurant is dim, moody and spacious with pool tables, a huge bar area and a misted patio. The vibe was very mellow on a weekday afternoon, but I can imagine it gets fairly busy on the weekends. After studying the extensive list of pastries (over two dozen), I went with the Carne Adovada from the premium list and the Cajun Chicken from the signature list and a side of the the broccoli cauliflower bake.\n\nThe broccoli cauliflower bake was delivered first. Think: healthy take on mac and cheese without giving up any of the flavor. The broccoli cauliflower dish was swimming in this wonderful cheese sauce and baked with tons of cheese on top creating a perfectly crisp exterior. Definitely delicious and a must order. \n\nThe pastries came next. Similar to a calzone but a lot less doughy, and a lot more flakey; the dough recipe is perfect because it is not overpowering to the savory delicious fillings. The Adovada was filled with simmered pork in New Mexican red chili stew, Mexican rice, hatch chilies and cheddar with a side of sour cream and salsa (the sides are switched in the photos). The pork was so tender and flavorful and the stew and chilies added a perfect kick. This was a British take on a Mexican influenced dish and it was a winner. The Cajun Chicken was filled with spicy cajun chicken breast, bacon, ham and Swiss and served with a side of chipotle sauce. The chicken was tender and the bacon added the right amount of smokiness paired with the chipotle sauce. I enjoyed this pastry as well, but the Adovada was the winner.\n\nWith so many options to choose from, you really can't go wrong here. I spend about fifteen minutes on the menu trying to decide which pasty to choose. There is something for everyone here with flavors ranging form Spanish influence, to Indian influence, to Mediterranean influence. The service was on point as well. We were directed to the main seating area by the host and the waitress took time to point out some of her favorites on the menu. She didn't seem to be very knowledgable on what each pasty included and the sauces were switched on my pastries, but all was forgiven after the first bite. There is a large private parking lot for the restaurant with free parking available. I'll be back next time I'm in town.",

It is nearly impossible for me to pick a favorite, they are all that good!\n\nIf you enjoy beer then Dean's selections will please you. Not a drab, tasteless lager in the bunch! Hoegaarden on draught as well as Guiness, Harp and Strongbow Cider plus a few others to keep a beer lover happy for a long time.\n\nThe current location is quite small however and it's proximity to ASU guarantees a packed house on Friday and Saturday nights. Happily, Dean is opening a second location in Mesa on Doson Rd. and Guadalupe Rd. that will not only be larger but has a more open environment as well. Opening has been announced for Saturday, January 17th 2009 and you can bet we'll be there.\n\nTake the time to find The Cornish Pasty Co. you will come back again and again!",

            "text": "I am reviewing the original Tempe location.  Given all the great reviews this place has gotten, I was wondering what I could add that hasn't already been said.  It's not only the only place in Tempe you can get a cornish pasty, but they are also freak'n awesome.  The Lovely Bit of Salmon was my favorite, but alas given my newly discovered gluten intolerance I am not able to part-take in such loveliness any more:  :(\n\nBut nevertheless, I still come here every now and then with my friends and husband.  They all chow down on the yummy pasties while I chow down on my salads, sides, and soups.  So, I decided to concentrate my review on those items. (Some of these dishes are not gluten free.  I had them before I found out about my gluten intolerance.) \n\nSoups:\nThey offer a variety of soups.  I have tried: 1) the cream of leek, potato, and stilton, 2) the cream of tomato and crouton, and 3) the red pepper, black bean, rice, chicken, and jalapeno.  They were all very good, but I was informed that only the red pepper one is gluten free.  I had the first two before I found out about my gluten intolerance.  Not only are their soups really tasty, full of flavor, they are all also accompanied by thick slices of fresh bread and butter, baked and churned in-house.  Absolutely delicious!  The are perfect accompaniments, and a bowl at $4.75 would make a tasty and light lunch that won't break the bank.  \n\nSides: \nThe garlic mashed potatoes and the garlic roasted potatoes are also very good.  Pretty much what you should expect.  Creamy mashed potatoes and nicely roasted red potatoes with a hint of garlic.  Not too garlicky.  \n\nThe mushy peas is one of my favorite side dishes that they serve.  I think I prefer them to the potatoes simply because they are something different that I can't get anywhere else.  And these ain't  no ordinary peas.  They are huge for peas.  Cooked really well.  Not too mushy (overcooked), even though they are \"mushy\" peas. There is a great texture and freshness to this dish.  The texture of these \"mushy peas\" is more like crunchy peanut butter than creamy peanut butter if we were speaking of peanut butter that is (it's an analogy. . . just go with it), and I think the freshness and the texture go hand in hand from not overcooking the peas.  \n\nThe broccoli and cauliflower cheese bake is also a nice dish.  It makes me think of mac'n cheese, but with cauliflower and broccoli instead of mac noodles.  I dont think this dish is gluten free.  It seems to be made with a cheese sauce that is thickened with a flour rue, then baked to give a nice golden, crusted top.  It was tasty as well, but could have used a bit more seasoning.  It was my least favorite of all the sides I have had. \n\nAll their salads are also pretty good.  The veggies in the salad are pretty much the same regardless of which salad you get: ice berg lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and onions.  Except for the Greek and pasta.  The Greek has feta and olives, and the pasta has a whole list of its own ingredients.  \n\nWhat differentiates the various salads are the additions and the dressing.  Beside the basic garden and Greek, the three other salads to choose from are: 1) the salmon or chicken caesar, 2) the chicken tikka salad, and 3) the sausage salad.  The salmon caesar is a great substitute for the Lovely Bit of Salmon pasty.  The salmon is cooked very well.  Juicy, not overcooked and not undercooked, seasoned just like the salmon in the Lovely Bit of Salmon.  Ask for a side of the white wine and dill dressing that usually accompanies the Lovely Bit of Salmon and you will not regret it.  That sauce is amazing.  This is my favorite salad. The chicken tikka is also good.  The chicken is marinated in a red rub or spice, like what you would find with tandoori chicken, and served on a salad with yogurt dressing.  Finally, the sausage salad was not my favorite.  They make the sausage in house, but I was a bit disappointed with the flavor and the way it was cooked.  It was overcooked, very dry, and a bit off.  I'm not sure if I would order it again.  I've had it twice and it was the same both times.\n\nOverall, this is one of the best restaurants in Tempe!",

Absolutely nothing, I knew.\n\nBut then, today turned out to be a special day...\nI was trapped - back to back meetings from early morning through late afternoon with no time for lunch. Fortunately for me a good friend but obviously not as hardworking co-worker on her way out the door offered to bring me something back. Where was she going? Pasty!!! She just needed to know what I wanted, of course. So I checked the Pasty to go menu hanging from the bars of my cell - oops - I mean the wall of my cube, and to my surprise discovered that this wasn't going to be just another Pasty... Being the quasi-vegetarian I am, I've been slowly working my way through their vegetarian menu (more than 10 delicious options, including my favorite eggplant parmesan), and there was only one left - the Veggie Tikka Masala. My 11th and final vegetarian pasty - quite the momentous occasion, don't you think?\n\nIt was while I was savoring the perfect mix of fake chicken, bell pepper and basmati rice in tikka masala sauce wrapped in that soft chewy crust, dipped in that rich mint-yogurt dressing that I realized, 50 reviews be damned. Something new to say or not, I've got to say it. So for what's it's worth, this is it.\n\nSo, in conclusion: If you haven't been to Pasty yet, you need to go - soon. Come on, man - 50 reviews with a 4 1/2 star average rating? This place so obviously rocks! One tip: if you go for lunch, go early (they open at 11). It gets pretty busy and takes longer the later and busier it gets. Going early is also recommended if there are more than 2 in your party - there are only a couple of tables that fit 3 or more (otherwise you'll be sittin' at separate tables, or at the bar - oh, and should you find yourself headed for the bar, try not to sit directly in front of the one of the ovens, as those seats get pretty freakin' warm).",

We arrived around 7ish and the place was packed, guess that's good sign right?  Only seating available was up by the bar, so off we went.\n\nAfter checking out the menu I knew I wanted to give the Peppered Steak a try, it had sirloin steak sautéed portabella mushrooms, leeks, roasted zucchini & stilton cheese with a side of peppercorn brandy cream sauce and for a side I ordered some British Chips. The pasty was delish, the flavors blended well together, and the crust was perfectly cooked I was pretty happy with my pasty,,,,,,,\n\nUntil I tried a bite of my friends, who ordered the Carne Adovada which was simmered pork in New Mexican red chili stew, Mexican rice, hatch chilies & cheddar and came with a side of sour cream & salsa, Oh My Lawd, that's just a perfect pocket of food! Instantly I had plate envy and no longer wanted mine, which was delish on its own. \n\nService was great and friendly, sitting at the bar was cool, and where we sat we were able to watch them prepare some more pastys to be cooked",

All of the pasties come with a side sauce or dressing ranging from red wine gravy, mint yogurt, tzatziki, tahini, to peppercorn brandy cream sauce.\n\nSince I love spicy food I normally get the Carne Adovada or the Cajun Chicken. \n\nCarne Adovada $9.50\nSimmered pork in New Mexican red chili stew, Mexican rice, hatch chilies and cheddar.

My boyfriend introduced me to this place and at first I was thinking of a fancy hot pocket (not something im particularly a fan of). As I walked in I was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere from the dim lights to the dingy checkerboard floor tiles, it reminded me of one of those hidden treasures I used to find burrowed around NYC. I ordered a hibiscus tea which if you are like me and enjoy unsweetened tea you will absolutely adore it. I poked through the menu and nothing really caught my eye until I came across the lamb vindaloo and I had made my decision. The food took a while to get there but considering the very chill setting and laid back personality surrounding this place it shouldn't bother you at all. It tasted great the only improvement they could have made was maybe putting a little rice in the pasty as well but to each his own. What really made this pasty delish was the cream sauce that accompanied it. I brought the heat down while complimenting the flavor. When all was said and done I was stuffed and had leftovers. We also go the garlic mashed potatoes which are equally as amazing but I would advise against getting them for take-out because they only taste good fresh. Me and my boyfriend love this place so much that we started a project where we get Cornish pasty once a week. He is starting at the top of the menu and im starting at the bottom and working our way down and up and trying every single pasty on the menu. Oh yes....its happening.",

            "text": "Reasons Why I Love CPC: \nGREAT FOOD\nGREAT PRICES\nGREAT ATMOSPHERE\nNICE STAFF\nDELIVERY!!\n \nI had never tasted the glory that is a pasty until I went there by recommendation of a friend a few years ago. Ever since my first visit, I have been hooked. I have learned to order one pasty for lunch, and get another to-go for later-- because knowing me, I will have a second craving during the day.\n\n  The first time I went I courageously tried their Chicken Tikka Masala pasty. My grandfather is from India, and I was raised on traditional Indian food, so I was a skeptic. However, their take on chicken masala (typically consisting of chicken, red curry, potatoes, vegetables and accompanied with rice) was impressive. There was just the right amount of curry to chicken to vegetable ratio, and I could not help but want to scarf it down. It was mild, so anyone could love it. Even their Vegetarian Tikka Masala pasty is delicious. As a former vegetarian and vegan, I am always skeptical when trying new meat substitutes, but the Quorn chicken substitute has a great consistency. \n \nAnother time I went, I tried their Shepherd's Pie Pasty, and declared that a victory. The pastry shell was crisp, the filling was flavorful, and the peas and carrots hadn't gone to mush. You can tell that they make the pasties (pastys?) fresh just by biting into them, but if you're not convinced, sit up at the bar and watch. \n\n  I will say, one of the best pasties they have is their Lovely Bit a Salmon. It took me a while to be able to order it because every time I tried, they were sold out (AND FOR GOOD REASONING!). I got lucky one unassuming Tuesday afternoon while ordering delivery for my mother, my roommate and myself. They were surprisingly prompt in their delivery and didn't seem to get lost with my crappy directions to my apartment. I ordered the Salmon, my mother the Pilgrim (SOOOO GOOD), and my roommate the Cheese Steak ( I didn't try his, but he said it was awesome). The Salmon pasty was heaven. I am not kidding- HEAVEN wrapped in a delicate pastry blanket and hand delivered from The Almighty Himself. The salmon was cooked to perfection, the dill sauce was mild, the asparagus still al dente, the potatoes were perfect, and the tomatoes and spinach were an added plus. \n\n My new favorite \"every-now-and-again\" pasty is The Peanut Butter and Jelly. HOLY GUACAMOLE! They have taken the traditional PB&J and slapped it in the face sent it home to it's momma. Then added some refinement, and some ooey-gooey, yummy in my tummy, goody-goody gumdrops to it. Holy Toledo. The banana is welcomed added bonus.  \n \nTo be honest, I have yet to try a pasty there that I do not like. This is a great thing, yet can be very unhelpful when trying to figure out what to have for lunch or dinner. \n\n Maybe someone can help me... I do not know what is in their salad dressing for their basic green salad... but it is AMAZING! \n Their garlic roasted potatoes and mushy peas are so yummy as well. \n\n They have my two drink requirements on tap: Guinness and Boddingtons. Also, they have Duvel which is one of my favorite Belgian beers for a moderate price. They have great Happy Hour drink specials including $3 car bombs. $3! YOU CAN'T BEAT THAT!\n\n Dine in, take out, or delivery. It doesn't matter how you get it, just GET IT! Make sure that if you order their green salad you get extra dressing--you will be happy that you did.",

I'm also thankful that they have so many vegetarian choices, seeing how I've noticed that many restaurants in the Valley rely way too much on meat products.

Although a few things have changed over the years each one is usually an improvement and never a negative. \n\nIf you are not familiar, a pasty is a traditional British coal miners food.  A hearty filling wrapped in a pie crust and baked. Kind of a hand-held meat pie. Cornish Pasty Co. has taken this simple and traditional dish and meticulously perfected each component. Their crusts are some how simultaneously hearty and flaky. Although their is nothing delicate about their seasoning it is never out of balance and all of the ingredients are always quality. \n\nBeyond just mastering the finer details of pasty science, Cornish Pasty Co. has also branched off into wild and exotic flavors. It's no shocker that the British know Indian food and it shows with the tika masala and the lamb vindaloo pasties. What is shocking is the refinement of the Greek and Italian inspired pasties. Perhaps my favorite pasty, from the cuisine most elusive to the British, is the Carne Avadado. This is a Mexican inspired pasty that will satisfy even the most snobby Las Cruses/El Paso foodie. If you have ever talked Mexican food with one you will know just what I mean. \n\nI have eaten nearly every item on the menu and not a one disappoints. It took me ages to get past the pasties and start ordering soups and salads. Now that I have had the spinach, mushroom, walnut soup, it is difficult to save room for my old favorites. \n\nAlthough the mine shaft inspired interior is dark and cramped I have never felt uncomfortable there. The sound system is usually bumping classic rock and the employees are pierced and tattooed well beyond your typical wait staff, but everyone is friendly and service is typically good.\n\nIf I have to list a negative the only one I can think of is the food is consistently just a little better at the University location than the Dobson one.  No clue why, but everyone I've talk to seems to agree, the Tempe store has the edge on quality.  \n\nAfter you add a respectable selection of beers the only reason you won't be here every night is your waist line.\n\n\nEdit (4/30/2014):\n\nFood's still good... but...  \n\nThe service has gone down hill. What was once a staff of edgy, unique, and skilled individuals. They are now mostly pretentious hipsters, with a bad attitude and below standard skills at basic service.",

Had a bite of the Italian as well, quite tasty in it's own right, although I picked out the big chunkier tomato, just a personal preference.\n\nIf the Tempe location is a bit cramped for you, and it DOES get pretty hectic in there sometimes, there's always their Mesa location which stays true to the formula but offers more seating room if you choose to dine in. \n\nDon't make the mistake of not trying CPC at least once, I've introduced many friends (and even my parents) to this spot, and I've never gotten a single complaint.

Well, maybe not 1,000 calories, but it's close- it's also worth it! \n\nPrior to abandoning meat, my favorite was the royale with cheese (minus the shrooms please). My favorite food in the entire world used to be a round patty of ground beef, sandwiched between two sesame seed buns until I discovered this little treasure. A pocket stuffed with ground beef, cheese,  grilled onions (and get this) french fries!! It honestly doesn't get any better than this. That is of course, until I became a vegetarian.\n\nNow my favorite guilty pleasure has become the cheese and onion pasty. Packed with potatoes, rutabega, cheese and onions, and lots of ketchup on the size. Even though I know all the sodium will cause me to bloat up like a blimp later, I just can't resist eating it all in one sitting. There's a robust vegetarian menu, featuring Quorn brand mock-meat which has been delicious each time I've tried it. \n\nAnd every now and then, when you're determined to stay on the old diet wagon, but everyone in your lunch meeting wants pasties, fear not, they do have a salad menu! The pasta salad is super yummy, and comes with the option of adding meat if you're looking for some additional protein.\n\nBottom line, there really is something for everyone at the Cornish Pasty Co.

The Oggie had steak, potatoes, onion and rutabaga and the crust was light and flakey.  The Royal with Cheese was a burger patty with onions, mushrooms, cheese and french fries, OMG!!

Sweet!\n\nThis location is definitely set up with the college kids in mind. Inside is very dark with black painted ceiling tiles and walls. Looks like the basement of a really old bar or maybe even a coal mine. Great place to gather up with the crew and down a few pints and then chow down on some tasty grub.\n\nTheir west side entrance has a long sit down bar with a few small tables and is rather cramped. The east side entrance has more of a full seating area with additional bar seating. Recommend using the east side one unless you are going undercover and need a quick escape.\n\nStarted with a cup of Cream of Leek, Potato & Stilton soup. It came with bread and butter and was very good. Ordered the Peppered Steak Pasty which is filled with Sirloin Steak, sautéed Portobello Mushrooms, Leeks, roasted Zucchini, and Stilton Bleu Cheese. It also came with a side of yummy Peppercorn Brandy Cream sauce.\n\nEverything was very satisfying. There are so many different versions of what they can make. Lamb, Chicken, Pork, Beef, and Veggie are just some of the fillings. I suppose you could make a check list and try them all. Hmmm?\n\nDon't forget some Dessert if you still have room. Can't wait to explore more of their delicious menu. Would probably go to the new Scottsdale location or the Mesa one on my next visit. Same great food with more lighting and better suited for a blind old fogey like me. PARTY ON TEMPE!\n\n3.75 STARS",

One of my favorites is the Veggie Rosemary Chicken (or non veggie version too). The sides (oven roasted potatoes) and salads are great too.

Obviously not leaving without dessert and having already enjoyed the sticky toffee pudding and bread pudding on my prior visit this time we opted for the house-special Banoffee Pie and Caramel Apple Pasty, neither as good as the pair off puddings but both better than the vast majority of in-house pastries at restaurants in Phoenix and Scottsdale (where even top tier restaurants choose to outsource their desserts to Ms. Dempsey.)",

Obviously not leaving without dessert and having already enjoyed the sticky toffee pudding and bread pudding on my prior visit this time we opted for the house-special Banoffee Pie and Caramel Apple Pasty, neither as good as the pair off puddings but both better than the vast majority of in-house pastries at restaurants in Phoenix and Scottsdale (where even top tier restaurants choose to outsource their desserts to Ms. Dempsey.)",

I had the Mushroom, Spinach, Walnut Soup, while my co-diners enjoyed the Leek soup - both were lick the bowl clean, as was the bread served with the soup. I appreciated at barrage of vegetarian Pasty options, both more with veggies (like the delicious balsamic portobello I had) as well as with faux meat, Quorn brand (yum!). My friends had the bangers and mash and the chicken greek pasties, and both were beyond satisfied. One took an order of Shirley Temple Pudding home -- if I wasn't visiting from out of town, I would have too - it smelled godly.\n\nWould suggest visiting during an off hour, as there are no seats for waiting, and it is ridiculously hot.

They were crimped at one end so that the miners with the soiled hands could eat them and just throw out the end they were holding. Here the pasties range from $9-$11 each and the pictures on Yelp can be deceiving. You may think they look like a empanada but in real life they are the size of calzone, they are large. \n\nMushroom, Walnut, Spinach Soup - I'm a big cream of mushroom fan so I had to try this out. I ordered a full bowl but they only brought me out a cup of it. I asked if it was a mistake and they said they were out of the soup for the night so they gave me the smaller cup for free! After one sip I was wishing there was a bowl of it, because it was that good. Creamy mushroom without overdoing it on the cream, pureed spinach and walnuts with a walnut chunk in almost every bite. Served with warm sourdough bread. One of the best versions of mushroom soup that I have ever had.\n\nLamb & Mint Pasty (Lamb, Potatoes, Rutabaga, Onion, Fresh Mint) - My friends got this and I tried a bite. It was good, not gamey at all and paired well with the red wine gravy. Recommended. \n\nPeppered Steak Pasty (Sirloin Steak, Sautéed Portabella Mushrooms, Leeks, Roasted Zucchini, Stilton Cheese) - My server recommended this and it was all good until I forgot that it had Stilton in it. Stilton is a strong bleu cheese.  Don't get me wrong, this pasty was done very well... I would have liked it better if it didn't have Stilton in it but that was my bad for missing that on the description. If you enjoy steak and blue cheese, you will love this! Personal preference aside, this is a 5 star pasty.  It comes with a side of peppercorn brandy cream sauce which is delicious. This sauce is lightly sweet and creamy with pepper flavor but no heat and would be great with most of their pasties. If you can, ask for a side of this even if your pasty doesn't come with it. \n\nIf I make it back to Phoenix I'm going to have to try the Pilgrim (turkey, sweet potatoes and cranberry sauce), the Oogie (steak, potatoes, rutabaga), Shepard's Pie and Chicken Tikka Masala. The veggie offerings also look stupendous. \n\nThe only thing a Brit would find lacking is in their beer offerings. They do not carry too many brews from the UK. You can't get a Black and Tan or a Smithwicks here. Not a biggie, but just thought I'd mention it. \n\nUnexpected was the staff giving me the soup for free when I would have gladly paid for the smaller portion offering since I did order it. It was only a $4.50 difference, but Cornish Pasty Company went above and beyond to get it right, even when they didn't have to. \n\nNow if only they could figure out how to open other Cornish Pasty Companies across the nation (California please?)...",

Sometimes it gets very busy, and the service can be slow, but the food is great.  If you do takeout, I would suggest getting the pasty once-baked (IE not cooked through).  They seem to batch prep, then finish cooking to order.. if you order once-baked, you can finish it off in your oven at your discretion, which can be better.\n\nThey tend to have British punk music about 3-4 days a week, never really payed attention to which days are which for music.  The atmosphere is okay, but I prefer the feel of the Scottsdale and Mesa locations, this one is just the closest to me.\n\nSome of my favorites include the Potato Leak Soup (best I've had anywhere), and the following pasties... The Mexican (vegetarian version is good too), Lamb Vindaloo (it's a little spicy), and the Carne Adovada.... I've haven't had anything that was outright bad, but the Royal had way more onion than I care for, and I also didn't care for The Italian either which was way too close to a calzone, but the difference in a pasty crust wasn't my taste.\n\nAll said, pretty much everyone can find something to like here... fair warning, it is definitely not a carb friendly menu.. there are a few salads which are good, but it's not their mainstay.",

            "text": "Started patronizing this Cornish Pasty location when they were just a hallway and a kitchen.   The place was awesome, with food you couldn't get anywhere else in town, and a great selection of craft beers.  It was fun to sit at the counter and watch them make the pastys.   I wish that I'd reviewed the place previously, as I would have given them 4 stars over probably a dozen previous visits but I wasn't really a Yelper then.    \n\nNow the place has expanded significantly, and it appears business volume has kept up with this expansion, which means they are almost certainly profitable.   And that's what makes my last visit so hard to understand.  \n\nFirst, our table in the back corner of the dining room -- the glass surface was broken from what was likely a few too many full plates and empty pints being forcefully put down on it, and it appeared as if many a beer had been spilled on that section of the table because the metal latticework under the cracked section of glass was a mysterious dull brown moldy/mildwey color for a good 2\"-3\" to each side of the glass.  But the lights were dim and it didn't smell so we decided to ignore it.  \n\nSecond, the men's room -- I stepped in here after we ordered but before our food was delivered.  This was one of the most disgusting restaurant men's rooms I've ever been in.  There was a lot of urine on the floor, broken tilework and molding everywhere. There were several paper towel dispensers, all of which were empty and appeared broken anyway, so I was forced to go find toilet paper to dry with after washing my hands.   All of the toilet paper rolls were sitting out on the back of the toilet or on top of what at one point had been a functioning tp dispenser.   To acquire some toilet paper meant picking the roll up off of a surface that looked like it hadn't been cleaned in days or maybe weeks.  I wish I hadn't glanced at the toilet.  There are dive bars that don't even serve food with bathrooms that are 100x as clean as this one was. \n\nThird, our food -- When I came out of the horribly filthy men's room, I should have immediately cancelled the food order and taken my family somewhere else for dinner.    That men's room was a sign.    My beer was not hot, but not cold, just cool.  It should have been a lot colder.  The three of us all ordered different pastys, mine was the Royale with Cheese, and we all felt sick late that night and into the next day.  If just one of us had felt sick, chalk it up to something else, but Cornish Pasty was the common denominator.  \n\nFinally, our service -- Our server was actually great.   She was prompt, checked up on us frequently, and got our orders exactly right.  She did a fine job, and the other stuff we experienced was not her fault.  I tipped her out well.  What I noticed though, was that while the place was slammed, other employees were, at times, inexplicably wandering around the restaurant with their phones held out in front of them, distracted, not paying attention to what was going on around them.   Not sorry to be an ass here - you're at work.   Snapchat your friends and Pokemon Go ANY OTHER TIME except for right now.    \n\nI don't care how slammed you are, how unique your food is, how close you are to the largest university in the nation or how many times I've been there in the past and been happy.  You can't manage a restaurant this way, there's absolutely no excuse for it.   If this place were to have received a health code inspection the night I took my wife and 17 yr old daughter there for dinner, I have no doubt they would have failed.   This is management's responsibility and ownership should hold them accountable.",

Holy effin-A!)\n\nHow: awesome was it? Quite. Nice atmosphere, see all positives noted in other reviews. Little things detracted from a five-star giving. However, I will be back.

Lamb, Chicken, Pork, Beef, and Veggie are just some of the fillings. I suppose you could make a check list and try them all. Hmmm?\n\nDon't forget some Dessert if you still have room. Can't wait to explore more of their delicious menu. Would probably go to the new Scottsdale location or the Mesa one on my next visit. Same great food with more lighting and better suited for a blind old fogey like me. PARTY ON TEMPE!\n\n3.75 STARS",

Yup, exactly like that, just totally different.\n\nCliffs notes:\n\nFood:  4 STARS\nDessert: 4 STARS\nService:  3 STARS\nPrice:  $8-9\n\nThe key here is the pastry.  The filling is really just the vehicle to the warm, puff pastry.  I personally ordered the Lamb Vindaloo, which IMO  probably was one of the few that didn't belong in a pastry.  The potato inside a pastry just doesn't go too well with me.  Luckily, I had 7 other girlfriends to free-load...err sample from.  The Mexican one was probably my favorite.  \n\nAlso worth noting is the Apple Pastry topped with Ice Cream.  Warm yummy pastry and ice cream combined?  Simple, but yummie nonetheless.\n\nFinally...come here during HH if you could.  $3.00 Irish Car Bombs.  Done.",

The beer selection was pretty good, but my husband ordered beer in a bottle that the menu stated cost $6.50.  When the check came, it cost $10.  The menu should probably be updated to reflect current pricing.\n\n  We ordered an Italian and a BBQ chicken pasty.  The expeditor brought out our pasties and we just started eating.  We realized that one of the pasties he brought out was not what we ordered.  It turns out he gave us the wrong order.  They all look the same on the outside, so how were we to know?  He apologized and they gave us the one we actually ordered to -go for free, which I thought was a really nice gesture.   It was also really cool to be able to watch them make the pasties right in front of us while sitting at one of the bars.",

Absolutely nothing, I knew.\n\nBut then, today turned out to be a special day...\nI was trapped - back to back meetings from early morning through late afternoon with no time for lunch. Fortunately for me a good friend but obviously not as hardworking co-worker on her way out the door offered to bring me something back. Where was she going? Pasty!!! She just needed to know what I wanted, of course. So I checked the Pasty to go menu hanging from the bars of my cell - oops - I mean the wall of my cube, and to my surprise discovered that this wasn't going to be just another Pasty... Being the quasi-vegetarian I am, I've been slowly working my way through their vegetarian menu (more than 10 delicious options, including my favorite eggplant parmesan), and there was only one left - the Veggie Tikka Masala. My 11th and final vegetarian pasty - quite the momentous occasion, don't you think?\n\nIt was while I was savoring the perfect mix of fake chicken, bell pepper and basmati rice in tikka masala sauce wrapped in that soft chewy crust, dipped in that rich mint-yogurt dressing that I realized, 50 reviews be damned. Something new to say or not, I've got to say it. So for what's it's worth, this is it.\n\nSo, in conclusion: If you haven't been to Pasty yet, you need to go - soon. Come on, man - 50 reviews with a 4 1/2 star average rating? This place so obviously rocks! One tip: if you go for lunch, go early (they open at 11). It gets pretty busy and takes longer the later and busier it gets. Going early is also recommended if there are more than 2 in your party - there are only a couple of tables that fit 3 or more (otherwise you'll be sittin' at separate tables, or at the bar - oh, and should you find yourself headed for the bar, try not to sit directly in front of the one of the ovens, as those seats get pretty freakin' warm).",

But with two separate doors and a very unique layout you must know it's a confusing restaurant. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with that, however that should be a focus for your employees, realizing that every guest should be greeted and either told where to sit or to seat themselves. I awkwardly walked into BOTH entries and neither time did a single employee say hello or even look my way. \n\nForgot to mention that prior to arriving I called in to check that there wasn't a cover for the fight (most bars were charging if they had the fight on) and the girl that answered was extremely rude (customer service is SO SIMPLE... it pains me when employees are so bad at basic people skills)! It was hard to convince my boyfriend to even give it a shot after speaking to her. \n\nSo after this and the lack of acknowledgment when I walked in I couldn't do it. I left, and very disappointed because I truly wanted to give this place a shot. Maybe I'll attempt another location one day.",

            "text": "Started patronizing this Cornish Pasty location when they were just a hallway and a kitchen.   The place was awesome, with food you couldn't get anywhere else in town, and a great selection of craft beers.  It was fun to sit at the counter and watch them make the pastys.   I wish that I'd reviewed the place previously, as I would have given them 4 stars over probably a dozen previous visits but I wasn't really a Yelper then.    \n\nNow the place has expanded significantly, and it appears business volume has kept up with this expansion, which means they are almost certainly profitable.   And that's what makes my last visit so hard to understand.  \n\nFirst, our table in the back corner of the dining room -- the glass surface was broken from what was likely a few too many full plates and empty pints being forcefully put down on it, and it appeared as if many a beer had been spilled on that section of the table because the metal latticework under the cracked section of glass was a mysterious dull brown moldy/mildwey color for a good 2\"-3\" to each side of the glass.  But the lights were dim and it didn't smell so we decided to ignore it.  \n\nSecond, the men's room -- I stepped in here after we ordered but before our food was delivered.  This was one of the most disgusting restaurant men's rooms I've ever been in.  There was a lot of urine on the floor, broken tilework and molding everywhere. There were several paper towel dispensers, all of which were empty and appeared broken anyway, so I was forced to go find toilet paper to dry with after washing my hands.   All of the toilet paper rolls were sitting out on the back of the toilet or on top of what at one point had been a functioning tp dispenser.   To acquire some toilet paper meant picking the roll up off of a surface that looked like it hadn't been cleaned in days or maybe weeks.  I wish I hadn't glanced at the toilet.  There are dive bars that don't even serve food with bathrooms that are 100x as clean as this one was. \n\nThird, our food -- When I came out of the horribly filthy men's room, I should have immediately cancelled the food order and taken my family somewhere else for dinner.    That men's room was a sign.    My beer was not hot, but not cold, just cool.  It should have been a lot colder.  The three of us all ordered different pastys, mine was the Royale with Cheese, and we all felt sick late that night and into the next day.  If just one of us had felt sick, chalk it up to something else, but Cornish Pasty was the common denominator.  \n\nFinally, our service -- Our server was actually great.   She was prompt, checked up on us frequently, and got our orders exactly right.  She did a fine job, and the other stuff we experienced was not her fault.  I tipped her out well.  What I noticed though, was that while the place was slammed, other employees were, at times, inexplicably wandering around the restaurant with their phones held out in front of them, distracted, not paying attention to what was going on around them.   Not sorry to be an ass here - you're at work.   Snapchat your friends and Pokemon Go ANY OTHER TIME except for right now.    \n\nI don't care how slammed you are, how unique your food is, how close you are to the largest university in the nation or how many times I've been there in the past and been happy.  You can't manage a restaurant this way, there's absolutely no excuse for it.   If this place were to have received a health code inspection the night I took my wife and 17 yr old daughter there for dinner, I have no doubt they would have failed.   This is management's responsibility and ownership should hold them accountable.",

Expect to sit alongside your mates and clip your bag to the bar as the place is truly tiny. Husband also got a light ale. \nRight away they wanted to take the order, but the menu is a fun adventure and as a first visit I really wanted to read all the selections. My family was starving so they just couldn't wait for me to meander over the varieties and the waitress was really eager to get moving. She said take your time, but she stood right there and so, I did feel a bit rushed. As a result I didn't order a side salad which I think would have made me happier.\nI was wondering if the Pasty was going to be enough, was it going to be soggy or burnt, was the crust going to be doughy or dry?  I mean I'm naturally a skeptical critic, why else would I Yelp? But my Pasty was perfect. It was not greasy, it was flaky but firm in the right parts, it wasn't burnt anywhere it was divine. My Pasty was not chock full of air pockets it was chock full of filling. My daughter could only eat half (she's 9) but the adults were perfectly satisfied without being bloated.\nI could bring my veggie friends/family here too.\nI knocked a star off because despite being not too busy we waited and waited to close out our check. She was too fast taking the order, and too slow to close us out. We didn't get to order any dessert because of our long wait with empty plates. Despite the unevenness of the service no one was rude or unpleasant and the pocket was so good we'll come back.  Next time I'm going to have the Reuben stuffed in there, my daughter wants to try the meatball and my husband just might have a Pilgrim (Thanksgiving in your hands! Lovely!) I know everyone can find a Pasty that they would like to eat here and I encourage you to go!\nUpdate: We did go back and have the above selections and I got a Chicken Tikka salad to share. Fabulous! I enjoyed the second visit even more. The Pilgrim is undeniably yum, the Reuben was chockfull of flavor, the meatball delighted my daughter but was so-so for me. The Indian spiced chicken was so tasty I wish they made it into a Pasty too. They do Lamb Vindaloo, so why not? I still recommend this place and will likely return a thrid time... so yummy.",

And though I felt as if I were in love at the beginning, the relationship seemed to spiral downhill in the end. \n\n-Oggie, the original pasty, with meat, potatoes, and gravy... was excellent, and set the stage for my obsession. \n-Italian was pretty decent as well, something like a more homemade type of pizza hot-pocket: with pepperoni, salami, ham, mozzarella, and stewed tomatoes, then served with a side of marinara sauce. \n-Lovely Bit Salmon was excellent!  Salmon, potatoes, asparagus... delicious!\n-Lamb Vindaloo, Lamb in red curry and potatoes... was decent, though I probably wouldn't get it again.  \n-Peppered Steak = GROSS, disgusting, worst thing I've ever received in any food making establishment.  I actually think mine was bad or rotten, and would've complained, but I'd taken it to go and so I was stuck with it.  I took one bite, gagged, spit it out, and threw it away.\n\nIf it weren't for the rotten peppered steak I received, I was going to give a 5-star review, but after it I think I'm being very forgiving with giving 4-stars.  Everything else was pretty excellent, so I'll try to forgive the one absolutely disgusting pasty.",

My own timeline merely has two distinct halves - the time before I ate at Cornish Pasty and the time after. Every memory, every experience, every relationship before I put that first savory bite of pasty in my mouth is merely a shade of everything afterwards.\n\nWhat had I been doing with my life? Had I really tasted - really, truly tasted - food before? With the fervor of a religious convert I questioned everything I once thought I knew about the gastronomical experience. Some people might accuse me of hyperbole, but rest assured, they're either idiots or they've never actually eaten at Cornish Pasty.\n\nI favor the Lovely Bit of Salmon pasty. Think of an ideal Salmon dinner - complete with asparagus and rosemary potatoes - rolled up into a perfectly baked calzone-like dough crust and that's about what you're eating. Served with a mustard cream sauce, it's about the tastiest thing on which you'll ever put your filthy mouth.\n\nIf that weren't enough, there're about 100 other pasties that will make your taste buds weep for joy and then ask for more. But wait there's more, they have beer. More specifically, they have Guinness, which happens to be the perfect drinkable compliment to the pasty. Funny how that works, huh?\n\nEnough talk, go get yourself to Cornish and have a life-changing experience. You can thank me later when I see you at the next Pasty Lovers Anonymous meeting.",

Last night we went, around dinner rush. The place was packed and I didnt know it was a \"seat yourself\" establishment. Our server directed us all the way to the back where we shared a table with some other people. This place has a really cozy feel, its definitely not a restaurant fit for large groups of people. I went with my boyfriend and his brother. I got the Lovely Bit o' Salmon pasty, boyfriend got the Meat & Cheese, and his brother got the Cajun Chicken. We also ordered the oven chips. It took a bit to get our food, but I didn't really mind. When we finally got our order, it was well worth the wait. The Salmon pasty (filled with salmon, asparagus, red potatoes, tomatoes and spinach) was delicious.. especially that dill sauce it came with. The oven chips were amazing as well! My boyfriend and his brother absolutely loved their pasties as well. I even got to try the meat & cheese.. WOW. So good. I'm a sucker for anything cheesy! \n\nAtmosphere wise, the place is really laid back, I liked how a lot of the people there had tattoos and I didnt feel like myself or any of the people I was with were being judged..sometimes we get treated differently just based off the fact that we have tattoos at places which is a big bummer! I did notice this place must be a hipster hangout since I saw a gaggle of them going out the back door, hahaha. \n\nI will definitely be back, as long as I'm good on my diet the rest of the week.. hahah.",

            "text": "Reasons Why I Love CPC: \nGREAT FOOD\nGREAT PRICES\nGREAT ATMOSPHERE\nNICE STAFF\nDELIVERY!!\n \nI had never tasted the glory that is a pasty until I went there by recommendation of a friend a few years ago. Ever since my first visit, I have been hooked. I have learned to order one pasty for lunch, and get another to-go for later-- because knowing me, I will have a second craving during the day.\n\n  The first time I went I courageously tried their Chicken Tikka Masala pasty. My grandfather is from India, and I was raised on traditional Indian food, so I was a skeptic. However, their take on chicken masala (typically consisting of chicken, red curry, potatoes, vegetables and accompanied with rice) was impressive. There was just the right amount of curry to chicken to vegetable ratio, and I could not help but want to scarf it down. It was mild, so anyone could love it. Even their Vegetarian Tikka Masala pasty is delicious. As a former vegetarian and vegan, I am always skeptical when trying new meat substitutes, but the Quorn chicken substitute has a great consistency. \n \nAnother time I went, I tried their Shepherd's Pie Pasty, and declared that a victory. The pastry shell was crisp, the filling was flavorful, and the peas and carrots hadn't gone to mush. You can tell that they make the pasties (pastys?) fresh just by biting into them, but if you're not convinced, sit up at the bar and watch. \n\n  I will say, one of the best pasties they have is their Lovely Bit a Salmon. It took me a while to be able to order it because every time I tried, they were sold out (AND FOR GOOD REASONING!). I got lucky one unassuming Tuesday afternoon while ordering delivery for my mother, my roommate and myself. They were surprisingly prompt in their delivery and didn't seem to get lost with my crappy directions to my apartment. I ordered the Salmon, my mother the Pilgrim (SOOOO GOOD), and my roommate the Cheese Steak ( I didn't try his, but he said it was awesome). The Salmon pasty was heaven. I am not kidding- HEAVEN wrapped in a delicate pastry blanket and hand delivered from The Almighty Himself. The salmon was cooked to perfection, the dill sauce was mild, the asparagus still al dente, the potatoes were perfect, and the tomatoes and spinach were an added plus. \n\n My new favorite \"every-now-and-again\" pasty is The Peanut Butter and Jelly. HOLY GUACAMOLE! They have taken the traditional PB&J and slapped it in the face sent it home to it's momma. Then added some refinement, and some ooey-gooey, yummy in my tummy, goody-goody gumdrops to it. Holy Toledo. The banana is welcomed added bonus.  \n \nTo be honest, I have yet to try a pasty there that I do not like. This is a great thing, yet can be very unhelpful when trying to figure out what to have for lunch or dinner. \n\n Maybe someone can help me... I do not know what is in their salad dressing for their basic green salad... but it is AMAZING! \n Their garlic roasted potatoes and mushy peas are so yummy as well. \n\n They have my two drink requirements on tap: Guinness and Boddingtons. Also, they have Duvel which is one of my favorite Belgian beers for a moderate price. They have great Happy Hour drink specials including $3 car bombs. $3! YOU CAN'T BEAT THAT!\n\n Dine in, take out, or delivery. It doesn't matter how you get it, just GET IT! Make sure that if you order their green salad you get extra dressing--you will be happy that you did.",

Expect to sit alongside your mates and clip your bag to the bar as the place is truly tiny. Husband also got a light ale. \nRight away they wanted to take the order, but the menu is a fun adventure and as a first visit I really wanted to read all the selections. My family was starving so they just couldn't wait for me to meander over the varieties and the waitress was really eager to get moving. She said take your time, but she stood right there and so, I did feel a bit rushed. As a result I didn't order a side salad which I think would have made me happier.\nI was wondering if the Pasty was going to be enough, was it going to be soggy or burnt, was the crust going to be doughy or dry?  I mean I'm naturally a skeptical critic, why else would I Yelp? But my Pasty was perfect. It was not greasy, it was flaky but firm in the right parts, it wasn't burnt anywhere it was divine. My Pasty was not chock full of air pockets it was chock full of filling. My daughter could only eat half (she's 9) but the adults were perfectly satisfied without being bloated.\nI could bring my veggie friends/family here too.\nI knocked a star off because despite being not too busy we waited and waited to close out our check. She was too fast taking the order, and too slow to close us out. We didn't get to order any dessert because of our long wait with empty plates. Despite the unevenness of the service no one was rude or unpleasant and the pocket was so good we'll come back.  Next time I'm going to have the Reuben stuffed in there, my daughter wants to try the meatball and my husband just might have a Pilgrim (Thanksgiving in your hands! Lovely!) I know everyone can find a Pasty that they would like to eat here and I encourage you to go!\nUpdate: We did go back and have the above selections and I got a Chicken Tikka salad to share. Fabulous! I enjoyed the second visit even more. The Pilgrim is undeniably yum, the Reuben was chockfull of flavor, the meatball delighted my daughter but was so-so for me. The Indian spiced chicken was so tasty I wish they made it into a Pasty too. They do Lamb Vindaloo, so why not? I still recommend this place and will likely return a thrid time... so yummy.",

And I'm so glad we came! They were pretty busy at 8:30pm on a Saturday night. Walked in, sat ourselves, and a server showed up a couple minutes later to take our drink orders. I'd say they were a bit slow and not as attentive as I'd like but its more of a pub feel and they were pretty busy anyway. We ordered the Crispin hard ale to share and it was pretty tasty, not very sweet. I like how they have a large selection international beers (like King Fisher from India!) on their menu, its like you really are in an English pub!\n\nOur group got the Porky, Rosemary chicken, Lamb vindaloo, and chicken tikka masala pasties. We also ordered the broccoli and cauliflower bake and banana dessert. They were all good but I loved my lamb vindaloo, it was like actual lamb vindaloo that you would get at an Indian restaurant! Ironically the chicken tikka was my least favorite because it was too tomato-ey but it wasn't terrible. The yogurt sauce that came with complemented the pasty perfectly. \n\nThe broccoli cauliflower bake was delicious and cheesy, totally hit the spot on a cold night! The banoffe banana dessert was ok but I was disappointed that it was mostly whipped cream (unsweetened). The caramel, graham cracker crust and sliced bananas were still enough to carry on the dish. \n\nOverall great food, fun casual atmosphere ( saw LOTS of people on dates here) and totally worth checking out if you're in Tempe!",

The ambiance is dark and pub-like. No getting around that. If that works for you, cool; most parents with little kids, however, will feel out of place, and not because of anything wrong.  I came here with my newborn and 3-year-old after the zoo, it felt awkward but was worth it for the food and beer.  If you come when it's comfortable outside, then you can sit outside and not be in the dark.\n2.  It's easier to see this place from Hardy Drive than from University Drive.\n\nOk now that's out of the way. The British pub ambiance here perfectly matches the food and beer. Great curated beer list, and the pasties are awesome. The bean dip starter had an interesting vinegar flavor, and came with great crackers (they were softer than normal crackers and I'm pretty sure house-made). The bread that came alongside the soup was definitely house-made and had gravitas. It was great!\nWhen I ordered my Rosemary chicken pasty, my server recommended a brown ale. It went great with my meal!   The crust was perfectly dense and flaky, and the insides breathed Rosemary while all the chicken and other vegetable flavors supported each other while sitting in a delicious sauce.  My mother in law is a vegetarian, so she ordered the onion and cheese, which I tasted and was FANTASTIC.  Service was really good and friendly throughout, and the food and beer support the time-travel and country-transporting effect that the ambiance offers. Definitely a go-to dining experience, even if you don't drink beer.",

I still call over to that location to see if anyone there wants to give me an excuse to make the drive across town to meet for a Black Velvet. Hello, my name is Kara... and I'm an unabashed alcoholic.  \n\nSo if you're following along, when we meet at Pasty Co, I'll already be full from a Sack's sandwich-- but as soon as I smell the baking dough & simmering spices, I'll be perusing the amply stocked vegetarian section of the menu and trying to decide between my three favorites-- The Mexican, The Rosemary Chicken, and the Tikka Masala.  And man alive, you can't drink at a place that's got such a great pub-style atmosphere and not have a great pub-style ale of which they have many.  That's my only complaint about this place-- I am compelled to eat hearty, drink hearty, and be merry until I about burst at the seams.  \n\nManaging a kitchen myself, I'm continuously amazed at what they can do with what little space they have!  Their seating area is only a bit longer and wider than their kitchen/prep area which is open to ogle and runs parallel to the grubbing area.  I enjoy sitting at the bar to spy on the process and trying to catch the staff eavesdropping on our loud bar banter.  I love when someone mashing potatoes chuckles at our drunken philosophy sessions.  \n\nParting Tip: As mentioned in other reviews, and their claim to fame (rightly so)-- $3 Irish Car Bombs!

When I cut myself shaving, I bleed red wine gravy.\n\nI frequent CPC more than I should.  Guilty as charged.  The food is just...so damn good.  I'm also a fan of their dfraft beer selection.  32oz mugs of Hoegaarden or Dead Guy ale?  Yes, please.\n\nI've turned many people on to the wonders of this place.  Out of all of my friends that tried it, the only one that didn't fully appreciate it was the one that had a lap band.  I don't recommend this place if your stomach is the size of a walnut because there will be some damage.\n\nI've tried nearly all of the pasties (with the exception of the vegetarian ones) and it's difficult to pick a favorite.  I guess if I had to narrow it down to three, I'd choose (in no particular order), the Oggie, the chicken greek and the pilgrim.  Damn delectable!\n\nI've also had their pasta salad.  It's huge.  I probably wouldn't get it again, though.  Why would I get that when I could have a pasty?  I thought I knew what comfort food was until I had my first pasty.\n\nOK, so what about the interior?  There isn't much of it!  It's a hole in the wall.  The Mesa location is quite bigger, so if you're dead set on trying the food on a Friday or Saturday, you may want to check out the Mesa setting.\n\nI've only had to wait for a table once, and it wasn't for very long, but I tend to visit during the off hours (late afternoon or later in the evening).  If you're flying solo, don't be ashamed to hop on a bar stool and watch the 20 something hipster dudes cook up gravy and other vittles.   \n\nSpeaking of the employees, they're a motley bunch.  Service is usually pretty decent.  If you're a fan of tattoos, nearly all of the employees are inked.  It definitely lends a sense of style to the place.  \n\nThere's a single unisex bathroom in the back.  If you gotta go, you gotta go.  I suggest forming a line if it's in use because I've seen people treat it like an airplane bathroom: they'll keep looking over their shoulder to see if the person inside has left and then get up, only to be cut off at the pass by someone seated closer doing the same bit.\n\nI've only had one bad pasty experience.  My pasty was slightly over-baked.  I think the guy that baked it was over-baked, too.  Look at the eyes of some of the cooks.  They're redder than the gravy!\n\nAt any rate, that one pasty doesn't warrant the loss of a star compared to the dozens of other perfect pasties that I've had.  I recommend this place to everyone.

There have been many stressful nights when all I wanted was to trade my periodic table and graphing calculator in for one of their apple caramel pasties. I have also heard wonderful things about the Strawberry Pavlova and the Banoffee Pie.",

Some late times at Time Out led me talking to a lady who works there, who told me of the Vegan Pasty one calls 45 minutes ahead of time. At 2am, with some amber bock, oh man, I was STOKED. I woke up the next morning, counting DOWN THE HOURS till I could dial that number for the vegan goodie. She recognized my voice, and I didnt have internet, so she was sweet enough to list the ingredients-I ended up getting eggplant and a bunch of other veggies. \n\nMy companion picked me up, and its on the HARDY side of the University and Hardy, fyi. We walked into a long, kind of dark hallway with small two seaters on the right and a bar on the left. Dude...were we in the right place? This place was SLEEK-black and white decor, clean, hip, I mean, like URBAN chic man, but not pretentious. Since it wasn't too buzy, we did the two-seater and she took our beer order (yummy beer selection-we did miss the happy hour at 5pm, but the prices were still fine), and ran into some friends. \n\nThe real star of this story is really the Pasty-I learned I could add some Quorn (the best meat substitute EVA), but that was ok. My food with some sauce was amazingly comforting. Not overly spiced, not overly cooked, loved the taters in it, I mean, there was nothing wrong with it-NOTHING. Like a shephards pie, or a pot pie, or a calzone, who doesn't love a warm fold...? Yeah? Yeah? This is the bomb. AND even though I was starving, I could barely finish it, but I felt perfectly content aftewards and not overstuffed at all. \n\nI even have their sticker on my CELL PHONE to advertise my love for this place-yeah, you heard right. I fucking BLINGED my cellie with Cornish Pasty!",

Every bite you got something new and it didn't even need both sauces, but the Tzitiki was excellent for dipping. dad had the Pilgrim (no turkey anymore), but had some nice roasted chicken and sweet poatoes and onions also.

I'm cheap so spending $9+ on an entree with no sides seemed like it wouldn't be worth it - boy was I wrong. \nWe did have some difficulty trying to find the front door as its not right off the main road (Hardy) you have to go the parking lot and there you see a door with the business name and hours, which still didn't look like the right door. We walked in and felt like we came in a side door or something but a friendly gal said we could seat ourselves. \nThe place was pretty dark and looked like it had been there awhile which didn't bother us. We picked a two-top table which seemed like it was on a stage, we didn't want to take up the large community style (looking) tables.\nWe were promptly greeted by a sweet gal named Casey. She made us feel comfortable as we explained we hadn't been there before. My bf ordered a tea and they had three options (Hibiscus, black and green) he choose the green and said he liked it. I wanted an Odell Isolation but they said they ran out so I went with a Union Jack IPA (az local) and was pleasantly surprised by the price when we received our check that it was only $4, awesome deal! \nI normally eat vegan so I asked about the vegan pastie specials (two choices daily) They had quite a few vegan options on the menu (like 10) but all of them included a fake meat (Quorn brand) and I am not a fan of vegan food trying to be like \"normal\" food, just wanted veggies and nothing fake. She said one special was a \"Philly cheese steak style\" and the other was a spinach artichoke which sounded like what I wanted. My BF ordered the chicken pot pie one cause he knew that would be hard to mess up. He really enjoyed his, its what he was expecting - perfect and legit. \nMine arrived and I noticed mine looked different which I expected. I also noticed it had Daiya cheese on it which I wasn't expecting, I wish the server would have mentioned that cause I am not really a fan. To me Daiya has such a strong distinct flavor that it usually takes over whatever its on or in. This was no exception but I felt Like this time it was at least semi balanced where it didn't totally take it over but it was definitely a predominate taste. I know lots of vegans like that cheese but I'm a weirdo and would rather forgo fake cheese. \nHis crust was tasty since it had real butter and mine was a bit drier but still surprisingly good, even the boyfriend was stealing some from my plate.\nNext time I'm just gonna get a non vegan one so I can get the full experience, I really wanted to try a curry one (with no fake meat).\nOverall awesome experience and when u are there you feel like you are in a place of history, even if you are not - I am not sure ;)",

I ask for extra sauce too, love it  \nYou can also buy pasties (as in 'past' not 'paste') to cook at home and they come out really well: just follow the instructions on the package they wrap for you. If you like beer there's a very comprehensive menu to satisfy all tastes. Vegetarians and vegans are also catered to, with special pasties full of veggies and other good things - I haven't tried those so can't judge, but from the standard of the ones I have had, I'd say those must be very good too.\nHave room for dessert?? okay then, I highly recommend the chocolate bread and butter pudding: yummy yum yum! of course the other desserts are great too, they even have a peanut butter and jelly pasty ....so bon appétit everyone\nand try not to get too addicted to these delicious concoctions....& if you don't already know why, read about the origins of the pasty while you wait for yours",

Any foodie knows there is more to a restaurant experience than a great product. An amazing restaurant has three basics covered:1) customer service 2) great food offerings 3) an overall great experience. This place lacks customer service which kills the experience. I stood there on a packed Tuesday and saw 3-5 different employees walk by with no acknowledgement that I existed. No eye contact, no greeting, no words at all! After 10 mins and a line out the door I left irritated and ticked. \n\nI sympathize with the youth movement and the college atmosphere this place has, however customer service needs to be emphasized to the men and women working the floor. They are the face of your store and if this trend continues, eventually customers will get fed up and go elsewhere. If I am an owner I would be pissed if this negative behavior was going on in my business. The business acumen is very important and should be a learning tool to teach the college kids the important lessons which can be applied to all different job titles. The staff I saw working tonight looked lazy and tired. Maybe due to the high temperature of the restaurant however with poor customer service and lack of a face in the entrance greeting me with a smile and a friendly greeting, it leaves me feeling like you don't want my money and you don't care enough about your customers standing around. Eventually the attitude of we have a superior product that ppl pay for and they not have to worry about customer service will come back to bite them in the butt.\n\n\nAreas for improvement\n\nThe waiters should be focused on turning tables and getting the checks as soon as the dessert is finished as opposed to walking around with their heads cut off. More tables being turned equates to more tips. I saw 4-6 tables sitting talking on their phone when they could have been served their checks or ordered more food. My avg time from start to finish was between 90-120 mins! You cut my time in the restaurant to 60 mins with efficient service and food running from the kitchen this place could double its profits and increase tips. \n\nThey need someone to work the front and greet the customers and let them know they are wanted, appreciated and they want to provide me with a great meal! \n\nDrinks out in under 5 mins from order (I waited 20 mins and she forgot about my 2nd beer later in the evening and I had to remind her so 30 mins for a pint of beer...total wait time for 2 drinks: 50 mins\n\nNotification on food times (depends on who is working) \n\nChallenge your servers to turn tables faster \n\nServers need to be smiling and social",

This place is A-MA-ZING...oh yes, it must be sounded out.\n\nI had friends in town from San Fransisco and they surfed Yelp to find a good place to eat in Phoenix...Cornish Pasty Co sounded awesome...and totally lived up to our expectations.  So much so that after eating there one night, we returned the night after for another round!\n\nWe sampled quite a few things from their menu...the Royale with Cheese was badass, the Chicken Alfredo pleasant, the Cajun wickedly delicious and spicy...and don't forget the Pilgrim, which is like having Thanksgiving bundled up and delivered to you in a wonderfully delicious pasty package.  AND the portions are big enough that you can eat half and be full, so the goodness can be enjoyed as a heated up lunch the next day!  BUT WAIT, THERE IS MORE!  We couldn't resist dessert...\n\nNight One:  Banoffee Pie.  Thick layer of graham cracker, wickedly thick layer of RICH caramel, a spattering of banana slices and then fresh whipped cream.  FREAKIN AWESOME.\n\nAND IT GETS EVEN BETTER!!!!\n\nNight Two:  Peanut Butter and Jelly Pasty.  Imagine amazing pastry smothered in chunky peanut butter, drizzled with raspberry jelly and encasing bananas...now top that with some more pastry, more jelly and whipped cream...not the sickening sweet shit that comes in cans...fresh, cool awesomeness disguised as a white blob.  THIS is the amazing Peanut Butter and Jelly Pasty...God's gift to man.  \n\nMy advice...SEEK OUT CORNISH PASTY CO, ALL YE FOOD LOVERS!!!  You will NOT be disappointed.",

I ask for extra sauce too, love it  \nYou can also buy pasties (as in 'past' not 'paste') to cook at home and they come out really well: just follow the instructions on the package they wrap for you. If you like beer there's a very comprehensive menu to satisfy all tastes. Vegetarians and vegans are also catered to, with special pasties full of veggies and other good things - I haven't tried those so can't judge, but from the standard of the ones I have had, I'd say those must be very good too.\nHave room for dessert?? okay then, I highly recommend the chocolate bread and butter pudding: yummy yum yum! of course the other desserts are great too, they even have a peanut butter and jelly pasty ....so bon appétit everyone\nand try not to get too addicted to these delicious concoctions....& if you don't already know why, read about the origins of the pasty while you wait for yours",

I admit, I was skeptical, I'm not a huge 'bread' or 'carb' fan, and I really don't like thick bread coated anything.  The pasties I've had in the past were similar to calzones in breadiness.  The pasties here, were something amazing and not at all what I've had in the past or imagined.  There menu was quite complete with heavier choices such as the meat and cheese to lighter chicken options and even some dessert pasties.  I opted for a chicken tikka masala pasty.  I was impressed by the presentation, a simple metal plate with the well portioned pasty cut in half and a side of tsaziki sauce.  The pasty crust was thin and delicate.  It was reminiscent of a hand worked Christmas pie dough that your Grandmother slaved over.  It wasn't too flaky or thick, and was the perfect match for the tasty filling.  The filling was delicious chunks of white meat chicken, little nibbles of potatoes and some peas in a deliciously balanced flavorful masala sauce.  The taste was quite authentic and the spice right on par with what I'd expect from an Indian food restaurant.  The tsaziki side sauce was cool and tangy, it was a good flavor contrast to the spicy meat pocket.  Since the  portion was rather large, I had more than half of my pasty left and took it to go.  I couldn't resist trying the PB&J pasty though.  I had one warmed and packaged to go.  I am SO glad I got the PB&J pasty as well.  It was so incredibly delicious!  Served with a side of fresh whipped cream, the PB&J was like an old childhood friend.  The warm crunchy peanut butter with the perfect banana slice and sweet strawberry jelly melted harmoniously in my mouth and still gave that satisfying 'coat your mouth' feeling that peanut butter does.  I will definitely return.",

It was kind of weird at first to have a conversation, but you get comfortable!\n\nWe decided to order 2 and share, so we could try more variety. We got a meat and cheese, which was served with a red wine sauce. Maybe because I am not a fan of red wine I didn't like the sauce!?!? But the pastry was so tasty! The meat was very flavorful and the cheese was gooey and yummy! \n\nWe also ordered the Lamb Vindaloo, wow was this spicy! Don't get me wrong I can handle spice! And I would say any more and it would be too much. The Sauce that came with it was necessary to cool off your mouth, and it helped that it was very tasty and refreshing! \n\nI am looking forward to going back and trying the many different pastries they have.\n\nBut please don't let me forget to mention dessert aka creamy heavenly goodness, that is the peanut butter and jelly pastry. Fresh hot out of the oven with jelly sauce....oh my! My mouth is watering just thinking about it! When you go, and you should, don't forget dessert!",

We waited a few minutes and were able to get two chairs at the bar. If you're sitting at the bar, you're essentially in the open kitchen as well. Like I said, it's very small! We had an awkward few minutes at the bar (sitting in front of people's empty plates), but someone finally gave us menus. \n\nWe ordered draft beer - Rogue Hazelnut Brown, which happens to be one of our favorites. I've never seen it on tap before, so we were pretty excited to try it. It did not disappoint! We ordered our pasties; I had the bangers and mash and my husband had the chicken tikka masala. I think we'd agree that they were both good, but nothing mind-blowing.  My husband is from England and thought the sausages didn't taste authentic. They were extremely sage-y and a bit tough. I was a bit disappointed that the \"mash\" was really just chunks of potatoes. The red wine gravy served on the side was good. \n\nI think it was a bit pricey for what we got - two pasties and two beers for $28. I wouldn't make a special trip to Tempe to have it again.",

We each picked a pasty of our choice and then split the mushy peas and roasted potatoes. Top it off with tapped hard cider and I was in oral heaven.\n\nThere was far too much food for two people to eat in one sitting. These little sandwiches are deceptively filling. And the incredible number of options from which to select from is a little mind boggling. My suggestion would be just to settle on one and then figure on a few return visits to round out the list.\n\nTables are tight, so this is definitely not a place to take the whole posse, but that's not a huge down-grade. The music is fairly loud and as I mentioned, I was there early, so I can only imagine that it must get really loud when the place is full. Amazingly, mom commented that she liked the music (who knew she was a Green Day fan) and thought the atmosphere was charming (not how I would have described it, but clearly its a place that is even parent friendly). She already has picked out her next two choices for return visits...\n\nA couple of things that really stood out to me: 1) You can get the Oggie (the basic pasty) partially cooked for a buck less than the menu price - then take it home and finish off the baking for that fresh out of the oven taste - very cool. 2) If you want desert, you have to order it first or share food, because there is no way to finish everything - sammie and side - and still want for more. 3) I've spent a lot of time in the mother land and don't remember the food every being this flavorful... but who really cares, this is good eats and did I mention the tapped hard cider?? (takes me to my happy place)!\n\nThis is a great unique food alternative for the down town Tempe area.",

I still call over to that location to see if anyone there wants to give me an excuse to make the drive across town to meet for a Black Velvet. Hello, my name is Kara... and I'm an unabashed alcoholic.  \n\nSo if you're following along, when we meet at Pasty Co, I'll already be full from a Sack's sandwich-- but as soon as I smell the baking dough & simmering spices, I'll be perusing the amply stocked vegetarian section of the menu and trying to decide between my three favorites-- The Mexican, The Rosemary Chicken, and the Tikka Masala.  And man alive, you can't drink at a place that's got such a great pub-style atmosphere and not have a great pub-style ale of which they have many.  That's my only complaint about this place-- I am compelled to eat hearty, drink hearty, and be merry until I about burst at the seams.  \n\nManaging a kitchen myself, I'm continuously amazed at what they can do with what little space they have!  Their seating area is only a bit longer and wider than their kitchen/prep area which is open to ogle and runs parallel to the grubbing area.  I enjoy sitting at the bar to spy on the process and trying to catch the staff eavesdropping on our loud bar banter.  I love when someone mashing potatoes chuckles at our drunken philosophy sessions.  \n\nParting Tip: As mentioned in other reviews, and their claim to fame (rightly so)-- $3 Irish Car Bombs! (I've seen places charge $6!!!). Oh, and don't forget the Banoffee Pie for dessert.  They make their own whip cream!",

Where do you want to go?\" It is a bit tucked away in a little strip mall, so I'm going to chalk it up to location and not the fact that I typically have the memory of a gnat.\n\nIf you've never had a pasty (pronounced pah-stee, unlike the pay-stee nipple adhesives strippers wear), you're missing out on a hearty English Hot Pocket. However, likening it to a Hot Pocket does it a disservice. Hot Pockets consist of cardboard crust filled with nuclear hot goo that causes blisters and cursing, rather than sighs of content and delight. While both are great drunk/hangover food, the Cornish Pasty Co. far surpasses the measly freezer dried Hot Pocket. \n\nWhile they have flavors that are also available as Hot Pocket varieties (taste test!), my dining partner routinely reminds me that he will shun me for indulge in one of those. Not that it's hard to find at least five different flavors that you could imagine chowing down. I always end up just blurting out my decision at the last minute to end my indecisiveness. They updated the menu recently and it now includes a bunch of flavors that weren't previously available, like carne adovada. Mmm. So if you haven't been here in a while, give it another go and try something new.\n\nFor about seven bucks you get a huge, stick-to-your-ribs pastry filled with a wide variety of meats and vegetables. I've never tried the vegetarian choices, but there are quite a few on the menu (about half as many as the non-vegetarian options). Among the traditional pasties, you can't go wrong with the oggie, shepards pie or lamb and mint. I've tried the chicken tikka masala, greek chicken, and lamb vindaloo from the fancy schmancy options and they were just as stellar. The greek salad is also pretty respectable, with a hefty amount of kalamata olives and feta cheese. \n\nWatching the cooks at work is part of the fun at this place, so have a seat at the bar. Just make sure to do so far enough away from the oven that you won't end up dried out like beef jerky at the end of your meal. When you get the bill, there's a cashier near the door that you can cash out at if you're in a hurry, since the servers are a little bit on the slow side. Slow, laid back, whatever. \n\nTheir happy hour is also an awesome option to opt for, and is offered every day from 3 to 5 pm. There's a dollar off beers, three dollar Irish car bombs and two dollar top shelf shots (Ketel One vodka, Jameson whiskey, etc.), so if you're looking to spend an afternoon getting stinko and munching on some awesome food, this is the place to be.\n\nUPDATE: I've tried just about every non-veggie pasty on the menu. The salmon trumps them all. Do it.",

I don't know that I've had a reuben in the valley that's comparable to how amazing this pasty is.  And the oven chips?  Forget about it!  Not that you need a side with the size of the pasties...Oh, the Apple Caramel Pasty is also pretty top notch for dessert - warm and gooey.\n\nTheir craft beer selection is also admirable, with a few local drafts (including Four Peaks and Oak Creek) and plenty of English-themed brews and English IPAs.  Full disclosure: as a beer geek, I only wish they didn't serve the beer in a frosted glass...it kinda affects the flavor.  Besides that, there is nothing I can complain about, especially since they recently expanded into the building next door, thus gaining about 5X the seating and space.

The taste of this food, and the English Pub feel of the place captured my heart! :) It's dark inside, and they were playing punk rock, and other rock in that same sort of vein.\n\nI ate at the bar. The bar tender is happy to make recommendations. For beer I had a 14 oz Bitburger, and then a 14 oz Kronenburg 1664. Both were cold and refreshing. \n\nMy appetizer was the crispy and flavorful scotch egg. It's a hard boiled egg wrapped in sausage with a fried outer crust. \n\nMy meal was the bangers & mash pasty. This must be what they serve up in heaven. It's a golden pastry filled with pork, sage sausage, grilled onions, and mashed potatoes. It comes with a side of red wine gravy. Un effing believable!\n\nFinished my meal with a nice neat 12 year scotch. And I'm in love.",

Until now  most of my experience with the pasties, or bridies as we called a  very similar dish In Scotland, has been uniformly  bad in the USA.  E.g  every  British theme pub has one on the menu  and seem to share the  same supplier.\n\nThis was so much better than I had hoped.  That they had draft cider too was  even better , a rarity in AZ, but perfect sense given the origin of the pasty in the English  West Country. Should have been Scrumpy ,a man can dream can't he? \n\nThe complaints about them not being traditional fillings is , well, odd. There wasn't a lot of variety in the UK diet,  less so on the working class end. So   On to the food.   Everything about the decor,  waiting time and suitability for groups is true.  Staff are friendly and  frankly it's nice to be left alone   rather than constant hovering. \n\nOnto the food. Pastry  rocks,  they've nailed it.   It supports the  contents right to the last.   \n\nFillings I had the Lamb Vindaloo which was close, but, but missing a sharpness/ e.g  vinegar, that I usually look for but it was still really good.  Dipping sauce complements it nicely.  My wife had the banger's and mash  version with  a red wine sauce.  Again  pretty good. \n\nSo why  four stars?    Many comments here have mentioned a lack of sensitivity  with regards to the flavors/ herbs and the thyme was   way overused on the bangers/mash gravy and it's  a shame as you could taste what they were trying to get at. Additionally the price may seem like a little on the high side ( would be  daily)  but  think about what you have paid for every processed , gray meat  excuse, of a pasty  and just smile.    Worth  working your way through the menu.",

So I called in at noon on a Sunday for a phone order. I ordered the Oggie since it seems like the popular item on the menu. I also wanted to try the oven baked chips, so I ordered that with garlic and jalapenos. \n\nWhen I arrived there, it had a fun, vibrant bar atmosphere. I like the decor, I noticed the whiskey bottles had this icicles on it. I went to the cashier/front to pick up my phone order. The cashier was very nice and responsive to my needs. Since my order wasn't ready, he kept asking me if I would like a drink. The wait staff also seems responsive and quick to others.\n\nIn terms of the food, the oggie was delicious. It was my first time trying an oggie. The outside was baked nicely and crispy. It wasn't soggy. It had a nice crisp but soft texture. The inside filling was soft and the flavors went well together. The red wine gravy also added great flavors to the oggie. Gravy was slightly sweet but also savory, so it brought out the flavors of the onions, potatoes and the beef of the inside of the oggie. The oven baked chips tasted like typical oven fries. The added garlic was delicious but the garlic aroma/flavor wasn't as strong as I would like. The jalapenos definitely added a kick to it, I wasn't expecting it to be that spicy. I ate the fries with the jalapeno and found it to be very spicy. Whenever I had garlic with the fries, it was delicious but I wanted more garlic to it. \n\nOggie reminds me of San Francisco's version of a peasant pie but slightly bigger and the outside has more flavor to it. It seems buttery, flakely. The SF one reminds me of a pot pie without a crispy crust.",

Where do you want to go?\" It is a bit tucked away in a little strip mall, so I'm going to chalk it up to location and not the fact that I typically have the memory of a gnat.\n\nIf you've never had a pasty (pronounced pah-stee, unlike the pay-stee nipple adhesives strippers wear), you're missing out on a hearty English Hot Pocket. However, likening it to a Hot Pocket does it a disservice. Hot Pockets consist of cardboard crust filled with nuclear hot goo that causes blisters and cursing, rather than sighs of content and delight. While both are great drunk/hangover food, the Cornish Pasty Co. far surpasses the measly freezer dried Hot Pocket. \n\nWhile they have flavors that are also available as Hot Pocket varieties (taste test!), my dining partner routinely reminds me that he will shun me for indulge in one of those. Not that it's hard to find at least five different flavors that you could imagine chowing down. I always end up just blurting out my decision at the last minute to end my indecisiveness. They updated the menu recently and it now includes a bunch of flavors that weren't previously available, like carne adovada. Mmm. So if you haven't been here in a while, give it another go and try something new.\n\nFor about seven bucks you get a huge, stick-to-your-ribs pastry filled with a wide variety of meats and vegetables. I've never tried the vegetarian choices, but there are quite a few on the menu (about half as many as the non-vegetarian options). Among the traditional pasties, you can't go wrong with the oggie, shepards pie or lamb and mint. I've tried the chicken tikka masala, greek chicken, and lamb vindaloo from the fancy schmancy options and they were just as stellar. The greek salad is also pretty respectable, with a hefty amount of kalamata olives and feta cheese. \n\nWatching the cooks at work is part of the fun at this place, so have a seat at the bar. Just make sure to do so far enough away from the oven that you won't end up dried out like beef jerky at the end of your meal. When you get the bill, there's a cashier near the door that you can cash out at if you're in a hurry, since the servers are a little bit on the slow side. Slow, laid back, whatever. \n\nTheir happy hour is also an awesome option to opt for, and is offered every day from 3 to 5 pm. There's a dollar off beers, three dollar Irish car bombs and two dollar top shelf shots (Ketel One vodka, Jameson whiskey, etc.), so if you're looking to spend an afternoon getting stinko and munching on some awesome food, this is the place to be.\n\nUPDATE: I've tried just about every non-veggie pasty on the menu. The salmon trumps them all. Do it.",

The restaurant is dim, moody and spacious with pool tables, a huge bar area and a misted patio. The vibe was very mellow on a weekday afternoon, but I can imagine it gets fairly busy on the weekends.

Think: healthy take on mac and cheese without giving up any of the flavor. The broccoli cauliflower dish was swimming in this wonderful cheese sauce and baked with tons of cheese on top creating a perfectly crisp exterior. Definitely delicious and a must order. \n\nThe pastries came next. Similar to a calzone but a lot less doughy, and a lot more flakey; the dough recipe is perfect because it is not overpowering to the savory delicious fillings. The Adovada was filled with simmered pork in New Mexican red chili stew, Mexican rice, hatch chilies and cheddar with a side of sour cream and salsa (the sides are switched in the photos). The pork was so tender and flavorful and the stew and chilies added a perfect kick. This was a British take on a Mexican influenced dish and it was a winner. The Cajun Chicken was filled with spicy cajun chicken breast, bacon, ham and Swiss and served with a side of chipotle sauce. The chicken was tender and the bacon added the right amount of smokiness paired with the chipotle sauce. I enjoyed this pastry as well, but the Adovada was the winner.\n\nWith so many options to choose from, you really can't go wrong here. I spend about fifteen minutes on the menu trying to decide which pasty to choose. There is something for everyone here with flavors ranging form Spanish influence, to Indian influence, to Mediterranean influence. The service was on point as well. We were directed to the main seating area by the host and the waitress took time to point out some of her favorites on the menu.

However, we got there at around 11:30am, and by noon there were no more seats available. Obviously the rest of Tempe knows just how great this place is. So if you want a seat, be sure to get there early or be prepared to wait. If you do wait though, it's totally worth it.",

He made it a point to visit this place every time he came into town, and he felt strongly that I should do the same. Now that I'm actually living in town, I made this happen. And I must say, I'm sad it took me this long to get there, because I've been missing out!\n\nFirst off, a pasty is a wonderful, flaky pocket of deliciousness. It's like the best pot pie crust wrapped completely around a variety of different combinations. The crust alone is fantastic, and when you put those fillings in it, I couldn't get enough.\n\nWhen I walked into this place, I kind of wondered where I had gotten myself. The Tempe location is nearly pitch black inside. On a positive note, it's a nice place to go in the middle of the hot summer here, because it was nice and cool inside. There's also a nice porch to eat outside if the weather permits. Seating is on a \"help yourself\" basis, and I think this may lend itself towards the servers not necessarily noticing you immediately. That's what happened to us, both at the beginning and the end of our meal.\n\nI had the Pilgrim pasty, which is essentially a Thanksgiving meal all wrapped inside a pastyl. It has turkey, grilled onions, sweet potatoes, chicken, and stuffing, and is served with a red wine gravy and cranberry sauce. I'm a sucker for cranberry sauce and for Thanksgiving in general, and this totally hit the spot! Normally I'd have been in a bit of a spot trying to decide among the various delicious-sounding options, but when I saw this one, I knew I had to have it. One of my friends had the Meat and Cheese pasty, and it was solid as well.\n\nI just looked at the menu again as I was writing this, and my mouth is watering now. There are so many other great selections, and I'm eager to get back and try more.\n\nIn summary, great food and unique atmosphere, but don't be in a rush, because the service isn't all that speedy.",

You then choose from their several selections of fillings and after not too long this wonderful breaded masterpiece arrives at your table.

If you've never been, they'll almost certainly have something you like. My only problem is that nothing is customizable: they're all served as is, which I understand from a production standpoint, but which frustrates for the number of menu items with just one dealbreaking ingredient for me.\n\nOverall, it's exceedingly easy to be a regular, and to feel VERY full, careful not to eat the crimped part of the pasty, just like the tin miners of yore so as to avoid the traces of arsenic from their dirty hands.",

I've never had a pasty before so I didn't know what to expect but judging from the pictures I had a general idea of what it would taste it. We came in fairly late around 10pm and since I was going to run the Arizona 1/2 marathon the following morning I opted for one of the lighter dishes. They truly have a wide variety of what would go in your pasty from burger, to Alfredo to even Indian chicken tikka masala. I ordered the salmon one, which I did enjoy. The crust went perfectly with the well cooked salmon. There was also spinach with dill sauce and other things that I can't remember. If I was feeling adventurous and didn't have to worry about eating light I would of ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala since our server said that was one of her favorites. Although we had no room for dessert we ordered a banoffee pie to go. This was really tasty as well great combination of bananas, gram cracker, whipped cream and caramel. From that Yelp picture the caption says it's Banana Cream pie, don't make the mistake of asking for it because our server corrected us and told us it was Banofee pie, haha! The inside of this place is a hybrid between a dive and a pub because it was dark and had community style tables. Our server was pretty good I guess but nothing memorable in terms of outstanding customer service. I can see why this is a popular spot among ASU students. Most if not all the pasty selections are less than $10. Even half a pasty is filling so you could even share one. Pasty places aren't too popular so I would definitely recommend trying them out. I don't know when I'll be in Phoenix again, but if I'm in the Tempe area I will definitely stop by.",

An eclectic list of Pasty's both 'traditional,' 'signature,' and 'premium' plus a collection of soups, salads, and sides I asked Hannah about portions on her return and told that each pasty clocked in at approximately a pound (and that two would be \"way too much\" food for a solo diner since she could only eat half of one) thus leading me to settle on a single option, a dish I was told would take \"about fifteen minutes,\" leaving me more time to study and enjoy the tunes - the White Stripes perhaps the only thing 'un-British' in a string of songs ranging from Zeppelin to The Beatles to The Ramones.\n\nReading as I waited and enjoying the room as well as watching the team slice meat, shape dough, and chop vegetables it would be just under a quarter hour before my dish arrived and although smaller than I'd imagined (I definitely could have eaten two - probably three if I didn't have dessert and dinner plans) the Shepherd's Pie that was presented was far better than I'd have ever expected, a golden buttery shell wrapped around lightly mint tinged lamb and although fatty and intense nicely balanced by the vegetables.  Generally a fan of Shepherd's Pie, particularly when using a sharp cheddar, this handheld version would prove to be an exemplary take on the classic and the addition of a sidecar of onion and sage laden red wine gravy certainly did not hurt.\n\nDebating a second pasty as Hannah returned to check in on me (The Pilgrim sounds quite good) but subsequently turning my attention to the sweeter half of the menu I decided to not make the same mistake twice and inquiring as to which dessert she recommended I went with my gut and ordered two to arrive with a delay between them, the first \"Shirley Temple's Pudding,\" a $6 sticky toffee pudding served in a cast iron pot with a side of crème anglaise.  Rich and thick, a dark treacle just barely set at the center and almost a brownie consistency along the edges what really shined about this dish was the manner in which it worked with the crème, a thick but delicate sauce balancing out the intense sweetness of the pudding.\n\nMoving next to my second dessert, and for my tastes the better of the two, a goodly delay of fifteen minutes brought to the table Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding with vanilla ice cream - a truly unique spin on bread pudding made with what almost seemed to be cracker-thin pieces of bread juxtaposing a brandy tinged chocolate sauce and baked much like the sticky toffee pudding to be set at the edges yet dense and moist at the center.  Truly a decadent dessert - the sort begging for a glass of milk or coffee - I will say that the ice cream was rather run-of-the-mill vanilla and although it served its purpose admirably I'd definitely go with more anglaise on subsequent visits - visits which I'm sure will happen the next time I find myself drawn back to Tempe, or to Mesa where there is apparently a second location whose Banoffee Pie and Apple Caramel Pasties seem to be calling.",

I completely loved it. They did such a good job with the flavors and the pasty also complemented it very well. I might end up ordering this exact same thing if I go there again.

For the basics, this is a British Pub that serves Pasty's. A pasty is the British version of a hot pocket or their take on the calzone, kinda. It is more crunchy and flaky, in a good way and they seemed to have figured out how to make them repeatably good.\n\nAfter a full day of hiking and walking around in the sun and sand of the Arizona desert we decided to stop by here for some much needed good food. My friends swore by this food, but I was a little skeptical as I am not the biggest fan of flaky things as main course. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala Pasty and it was awesome. I completely loved it. They did such a good job with the flavors and the pasty also complemented it very well. I might end up ordering this exact same thing if I go there again. My friends had mentioned that the Pesto Chicken Pasty is also very good and might be on the list of things to try next.\n\nWe tried some deserts also. We had the Strawberry Pavlova and the Chocolate Bread And Butter Pudding. Both were very good and worth having again, but I have a bias towards chocolate so will say that I loved the Chocolate Bread And Butter Pudding a little more. The warm, moist and flavorful inside with the crunchy and yet flavorful outside made for a killer combination. It tasted very good just by itself and also with the pudding/ice cream.\n\nI look forward to going to this place again.",

Who looks and that and doesn't think, \"I want that inside of me\" immediately? Nobody.\n\nWhen I ordered it, the waiter replied with, \"You know what makes this even better? If you ordered a shot of Rumple Minze (peppermint liqueur) and dipped your spoon in it before every bite.\" As if it needed to be better.\n\nNow I might never get a pasty from Cornish Pasty Co., but gaddamnit, rules were made to be broken.

Personally, I like the small dark divey feel.\n\nThey also serve Rogue beer which is delicious if you haven't tried it. \n\nI like this place so much I eat there whenever I am in the area, which has prevented me from trying many other places nearby but I cant seem to bring myself not to go to Cornish as it is so good every time.\n\nHighly recommend it if you are in the area.",

At the end of the 3rd day, I had seen enough food to feed the LSU National champion football team.  I could out fast Les or Bear on their survivor shows\n\nDinner time was approaching.....My business associate and I couldn't face a full course dinner for at least another 24 hours...but we knew we had to eat something so we wouldnt wake up at 3 am famished.  I remembers reading about this place in Yelp that would be perfect for our situation....so remembering some favorable Yelp reviews in Phoenix  I said to him:\n\n\"How about pastys for dinner?\"\n\nHe went from a relaxed and carefree disposition to a stunned and shocked demeanor.   He looked me like I was from another planet and his glance indicated doubt about my integrity.   Then with a delayed but dry smile he spoke up and said....\n\n\"Aren't those things they wear at the.....\"\n\n\"NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!    Not pasties......pastys.\"   I retorted quickly before the people in the lobby heard the next nouns he was just about to utter.   \"Pasty's with a short vowel, not long.   Have you ever had one.?\"\n\nStill thinking of the long vowel version, he hesitated a little and answered with a \"No\" veiled with a lot of doubt and concern.\n\n\"Good.   That's where we're going.\"    As I glanced over to him, I could see a sense of curiousity, dispair and expectation of upcoming chaos.\n\nWe arrived at 7:45 pm.   It's dark everywhere.   In the street, in the parking lot.   We enter the restaurant and it's no brighter.   \n\nIt is a very narrow and long restaurant with just enough room for seats at the bar nearly the length of the store and small side tables on the side.  The interior decoration theme is obvious here.   Build the biggest bar that would fit in this row house type of store, and accessorize the rest of the restaurant around the bar.  \n\nSitting in a very dark restaurant, with Beatle music blaring away, this English pub type of place had a huge variety of pastys....from traditional steak and potatoes, to bangers and mash, to more contempory selections that include vegetarian, curries, and fish.   They have a huge selection of international beers, many of which are of the UK......duhhh.\n\nI wanted to eat \"light\" so I selected the Lovely Bit a Salmon which is\nAtlantic Salmon in a white wine cream & dill sauce, sauted asparagus, spinach, roasted red potatoes, spinach and roasted tomatoes. \n\nWHAT A GREAT DISH.   Everything was layered carefully inside the pasty which was served cut in half.  The salmon was cooked perfectly.  The asparagus was not over cooked but had a crunch.   All the flavors blended well together.   I still wasn't hungry so I took one half of it back to the hotel....and had it for breakfast the following morning......which tasted just great.\n\nMy buddy had Spicy Asiago Chicken which was spicy chicken, roasted corn, black beans, asiago cheese, hatch chilies, and Mexican stewed tomatoes with a side of sour cream & salsa.   That too was excellent.\n\nIf ever in Phoenix, this would be worth any drive to have lunch or dinner and a beer.\n\nAfter dinner I asked him if he would return to eat here and he said he readily would.    Then I detected a slight pause and a curl of a smile in the background.........maybe he was fantasizing buying a long vowel...",

The mixture of chicken, cheese, beans, corn, and salsa inside had a nice and slightly spicy Mexican flare. The pasty was something like $6 and plenty for one person. The food is definitely the high point for this place.\n\nThe place was very busy when we arrived with about 8 people and we had to wait a long time to snatch a table (we were on \"the list\" but they don't appear to actually honor any such arrangements versus a free-for-all). There was also only one server running around the whole place, so it was difficult to place orders, get refills, remove leftover encrusted plates, etc. The drinks are priced relatively low and there were many types of beers on tap, which probably makes it a popular place for the college crowd. \n\nOverall, this might be a nice place to actually dine if it had better service and wasn't such a dive bar rather than an eatery. It would be nice if there were separate areas for a dinning room and bar. Right now, it seems like it really wants to be a bar, but it happens to randomly serve some good food.",

The brand of \"wheat meat\" that they use actually had good flavor and an unusually normal texture.  The pasty also contained corn, black beans, hatch chiles, stewed tomatoes, and was not overwhelmingly heaped with asiago cheese.  The salsa that was served on the side was flavorful and a nice accompaniment to the already spicy pasty.  The crust was flavorful and flaky, just like the pasties that I remember getting growing up.  The only drawback is that the place is incredibly small and between the loud music and the conversations of other customers, my ears were ringing by the time I left.

For those of you who don't know what a pasty is, it's basically a baked pastry case filled with your choice of ingredients. Very much resembles a pie. Pasties are the only item on the menu but there are a wide variety of flavors. I had the Oggy, and it was enjoyable mostly because it was different than most foods I eat for lunch or have even tried before (and it seemed the most British). The ingredients are not amazing, but overall it was a good lunch. Dip your pasty in ketchup so it isn't so dry. \n\nPRICE: The pasties are kinda expensive for what you get. A pasty will run for about $8-9 without any sides. The pasties aren't very large, but will be enough for a lunch. \n\nSERVICE: We were served by a nice girl, and the lunch went very smoothly. \n\nATMOSPHERE: Very thin dining area. Only one table can sit 3 people, the rest are bar stools and 2 person tables. Didn't really seem British with the metal rock playing in the kitchen either.

The new expansion is awesome! The beer they have on tap is fantastic, the staff is always welcoming and friendly! They've done such a great job. I recommend this place to everyone and I try to visit at least every couple months or so. Every time someone visits from out of town, I make sure to bring them there. If someone has never heard of it before, I tell them all about it. Many people have been pleased by going after I tell them about it! I've never heard any complaints. I only have 1 of my own, and its never stopped me from returning. I had one bad pasty, too much garlic. I can't say how many times I've visited, but its always been a very enjoyable experience. I will keep returning, keep talking them up and still bring in new visitors with me!! \n\nI love the Royale with Cheese, Cajun Chicken, Chicken Alfredo is my favorite, Pesto Chicken and Rosemary Chicken. I always want to try new ones, but I love getting the ones I know I already love! Oh, and you must try the banoffee pie! I'm not a sweets or dessert person, but oh my, it is to die for!",

Came in with my wife and sat at the bar and was greeted by Josh, one of the bartenders. He was very nice and very informative about everything, especially all of our questions about liquor and beer. He had of great information he shared with us and was able to make us some great classic cocktails that we never knew could be done there and he did them wonderfully. Definitely want to come back when he's working and see what else he can make for us. \nIt's great to be in a place with such great quality and none of the attitude you get from some places that projects a high end image.

They have a fine beer selection (including Mickey's Big-Mouths) and a few cocktail options... Most of the sides and desserts are pretty solid.\n\nI tend to stick with and very much enjoy the more traditional pasties like The Oggie, and the Cottage Pie (OK, OK... I love the Royale with Cheese, too). However, some of the \"premium\" pasties like the Pesto Chicken and the Salmon pasty are a bit funky to me. \n\nEven that, I can write off to personal preference.\n\nWhat really keeps the CPC from getting another star or two is the restaurant itself. \n\nIt's a long, narrow space, 75% of which is divided by a bar. Seating is along the wall or at the bar, with a few larger tables in the back. \n\nOn the other side of the bar from the customers is where ALL of the restaurant operations take place; cooking, cleaning, prep, and bar. If one is sitting at the bar, this intersection of consumption with infrastructure is often a bit too much like watching sausage being made. \n\nI don't really expect a fine dining experience at a place like the Cornish Pasty, but I really don't need to hear the dishes crashing into the sink and i don't need to see all the potential for cross-contamination (food preparation right next to the dirty dishes and raw meat right next to the beer glasses). \n\nMy worst experience was arriving late and sitting at the bar while they were cleaning the \"kitchen\" area and still serving food. It was really noisy, the refrigerator light kept blinding me, and the smell of cleaning chemicals was so strong that it made it impossible for me to even think about enjoying the pasty. I walked out after about 4 bites...\n\nI've wanted to go back several times, because I do enjoy the food and beer options, and finally went back last Friday. The food was as good as it's ever been but the environment will still make me think 2 or 3 times before heading back.\n\nMaybe I'll just have to take advantage of their take-out and stop at Tops liquor on my way home for the Hoegaarden...",

            "text": "It has been a LONG TIME since I have been to this place, but I would love to put my 10 cents in.  First off, before eating here I didn't even know meat pies existed.  It was like an awesome burrito but with a flaky crust and WAY more choices.  When I lived in Tempe I was a terribly picky eater and every single time I came in I got the same thing, the meatball pasty.  It was awesome, everytime.  Everything on the menu looks delicious and it looks like the flavors blend together very well.  They are premade before you get there, so you cant really have them take ingredients out, although I am sure if you let them know ahead of time it can be arranged.\n\nSo there are 2 things I would like to talk about here.  First, the atmosphere.  Walking in you have a tiny restaurant that has a bar on one side and some small tables against the wall.  All the waiters are tatted up and lend an air of ruggedness to the joint.  As you sit at the bar, they are right in front of you rolling up the pasties and behind them are the stoves that they bake your pies in after you order them.  So basically you are sitting at a bar, drinking a cold beer and you can feel the heat from the ovens.  In some places this would be annoying, but again I feel like it lends greatness to the atmosphere.  The music is usually some good British rock and once again, yes, lends to the atmosphere.  So I enjoy feeling like I am in some tiny pub in Cornwall.\n\nSecond, THE DESSERT!  I will start with the Strawberry Pavlova which I could have done without.  The meringue shell is light and unless that is your cup of tea, keep on reading.  The PB&J pasty I only had one time and it was good, but second rate for me compared to the next two items.  Next up is the caramel apple pasty.  Delish!  Apple and caramel baked into the pie shell and topped with ice cream.  However nothing in this world can touch the BANOFFEE Pie!  Dig this real quick, a thick graham cracker pie crust.  Top that with caramel.  Top that with whipped cream and top that with bananas.  Oh, and if you are crazy ask them for strawberries too...and ice cream.  Now eat that and tell me you've had a better dessert.  I sure as hell havent!",

            "text": "All my life I thought the Irish were responsible for rainbows. Fantasies of red-bearded drunks dancing in shamrock fields with pots of gold had always accompanied the notorious rainbow in my childhood imagination. Then, I assumed the gays stole it. I was wrong. The Cornish own the rainbow. Let me explain:\n \nI became stranded in the Arizona desert when my Pinto got not one, but four flat tires. (Hit a hot speed bump and the tires melted right off.) I realized that I didn't have any food or water. At that moment, I knew I'd be fighting for my life.\n\nMy heart began to race. I was on the verge of having a panic attack. I had to settle myself down. I took a few deep breaths and knew what I needed--smooth jazz. I turned the radio to 95.5 KYOT (The Valley's original smooth jazz station). I couldn't believe my ears. Coolio's \"Gangsta's Paradise\" was blaring through my speakers. Projectile vomit shot out my mouth. Had my entire childhood been sold down the dry canal? I thought God was playing a sick trick on me. I shuffled through radio stations faster than old people shuffle board (i.e. I took my time). But, it was true. Thee \"Coyote\" sold out.\n\nAll hope had been lost. My spirit was shattered, and the little moisture I had left was now a soggy puddle in the passenger's seat. I was in a dire situation. In desperation, I checked between the seat cushions hoping to find some crumbs to eat but, instead, found a few petrified McDonald french fries. I looked at them and thought to myself: \"I'd rather eat pigeon crap.\" I flicked the fries out of my Pinto. I used my finger to write a goodbye message on the dirt-crusted windshield and began my trek across the arid valley. \n\nAs far as I could see, nothing but cacti and cheap Mexican food restaurants. The little vegetation was riddled with thorns and bore no fruit. The thought of a carne asada burrito tempted me like a mirage, but I knew the explosive diarrhea I'd get would dry me out quicker than a sponge in the sun. I had to stay strong and keep going. \n\nAfter four long minutes of walking, I gave up. The sun leached my energy and exhausted all remaining calories. The horizon held no signs of hope. Just signs for Filiberto's, Amado's, Los Favorito's, Armando's, Pedrito's, and Taco Bell. My pasty skin was turning pink and my balls looked like raisins, so I sat in the shade of a palo verde tree and prayed. I begged God not to let me die. I repented for my sins. I promised that if he let me live I'd never do anything bad ever again. \n\nThen, out of the blue, I felt drops of wetness on my bald scalp. I looked up to the sky and saw that a pigeon was dropping deuces from the branch above. (I guess He wasn't too fond of me flicking french fries onto the desert ground.) God trickled the sign I was begging for right on my forehead, and now He was putting me to the test. If I wanted to be saved, I'd have to eat pigeon deux. So, I bowed my head, placed my palms together, and said grace. \n\nThere was a trembling rumble that echoed across the desert, and it wasn't the sound of me regurgitating. As I stood up from the gravel to peer into the abyss of newly formed clouds, a surge of water swept my legs out from under me. Before I knew it, I was being carried away in a flash flood. \n\nMy next memory was waking to the sound of chirping birds. I flinched and covered my face fearing that I may be lying under another pigeon-riddled palo verde. I opened my eyes and was blinded by colors. I didn't know what was going on. Vibrant reds, yellows, and blues! I had no idea where I was. I got so scared, I pooped a Skittle. Then, it hit me. You know when people say that it's impossible to reach the end of the rainbow? It's a lie. It's at the entrance of a mystical place called Cornish Pasty. \n\nI entered the land of the Cornish and it was like no place I'd ever been. I expected leprechauns but encountered a species far more enchanting, with skins of the finest tapestries and earlobes so large and peculiar that they could double as tire swings. Apparently, I wasn't the first person to reach the End of the Rainbow, because this place was packed tighter than a carton of cigarettes. I tracked down one of these Cornish creatures and told her my story, explaining how famished I was. She was unusually polite and let me sit in her earlobe until a seat opened up at a table. I swung around the restaurant as she went from table to table, filling mugs up with magically frothy beer. Then, I whispered in her ear: \"Are there pots of gold here?\" A spot at a table had opened up, and she sat me down. She told me that she'd be right back. \n\nI sketched pictures of these Cornish creatures as I waited. The troll returned and placed a dish in front of me. She gave me a wink, then walked away. I grabbed the warm pocket of food that rested on the metal dish before me, stuffed it in my mouth, and died.\n\nIt was gold, my friends.",

The Pilgrim on the other hand is like that delicious meal you make the day after Thanksgiving with all the leftovers. It has turkey, stuffing, and sweet potatoes. It's delicious by itself but with the wine gravy and cranberry sauce it's become out of this world! It's like what a chicken pot pie wishes it could be and you'll be thinking about that wine gravy sauce at Thanksgiving wishing you had some. \n\nLastly, for dessert, and no meal at Cornish Pasty Co. can be complete without it, the chocolate bread pudding. Now you may be saying \"But Connor, I've had bread pudding and I don't like it.\" That's fine. It's literally like no other bread pudding. For starters I'm fairly certain the \"bread\" they use is cake. Secondly it's not cooked into a complete mush or gel. The layers of delicious sweet cake are clearly evident when you get it. About four layers on each one typed with creme anglaise and ice cream. Each bite is incredible.",

On this occasion, My bf and I shared the meatball, while I got the chicken tikka masala and he got the carne adovara (spelling?).

For the first time, I went to a Yelp-recommended place and was very disappointed. \n\nFirst of all, the place is a dump. It's run down and kind of dirty...or at least gives off a dirty feel.I have seen the new Pasty that is over on Guadalupe in Mesa and the decor is very nice and it's clean.  This location is not wheelchair friendly at all and don't bother bringing more than 4 people unless you plan to stand at the bar. \n\nI'm not sure if they were employees or just friends of the employees who were working there but there was a group of college age guys hanging around both behind the counter pouring their own drinks and lounging in front of the counter who were just filthy. They had dirty beards, dirty hair, dirty ripped up clothes....I had no idea that the new look in college guys was homeless-chic.  \n\nThe food was....eh. My son had the meat and cheese pasty and I had the rueben. We shared our pasties and I was no more impressed with the meat and cheese than I was with the rueben. They weren't bad...they were just eh at best. You get the pasty...no side dish, no salad, no nothing. It's not really a value. \n\nOur server was pleasant but nothing special. She served our food and kept our cokes filled. It was clear that the focus was on the bar. There were about 9 people just hanging out at the bar, which is fine, but the place isn't advertised as a bar. I had brought my 8 year old son and this place is really not kid friendly given the amount of attention given to the bar and the dirty patrons/employees who were hanging around. \n\nIf I do go back to Cornish Pasty it will likely be at the newer location which is why I give it 2 stars and not 1 because as a chain, it might be worth the 2nd visit.

But let me back up a bit.\n\nThe very first time someone told me about \"The Pasty,\" as I refer to it, they described a pasty as \"a gourmet hot pocket.\" Let me tell you, that did not sound appealing. Despite how great they tried to make it sound, I could not get over the idea of a gourmet hot pocket. So I never checked it out until maybe a year ago when I was recommended by another friend, and figured I'd just give it a shot. It was delightful!\n\nI've since been to The Pasty multiple times. It's the food that keeps me coming back. \"The Pilgrim\" is like Thanksgiving! I get it almost every time. It's a combination of turkey, sweet potatoes, onions, mushrooms, and other wonderful flavors inside. Served with a side of cranberry sauce and a red wine gravy. I'm not too crazy about the gravy, but the cranberry sauce is awesome. I've also tried their Greek salad and black bean soup, which are just as wonderful. I love the bread that comes with the soup, and the dressing on the salad.\n\nAlthough this location is closer to my house, I prefer going to the one on Guadalupe and Dobson because the service is slightly better (although both locations have poor service). And this location on University is way too dark and full of hipsters. But, I guess people dig that nowadays.\n\nThe main reason I'm writing this review is because of a trip I made to this location yesterday. I went with my boyfriend and we split all three items mentioned above. The Greek salad, black bean soup, and The Pilgrim. I was starving and was hoping our server would bring the soup and salad out first. I was thrilled when she came back after a couple minutes with the soup and was hoping the salad would come out shortly after. I love bread and when we ran out of bread (meaning after I scarfed all the bread down), I patiently waited for our server to come back around so I could ask for more bread, as well as the status on our salad. Remember when I said I was starving? Well, I start to get a little cranky when I'm hungry, and our server was not making any rounds to see how her tables were doing. After fifteen or so minutes, I decide to go over to where our server is talking with another server, and ask for more bread, nicely of course. Once she comes back with our bread, the soup is cold, but I don't really mind. I was just happy she put more bread in front of me. A few minutes later our pasty comes out. She had obviously forgotten about our salad (guess that's what happens when you don't write anything down) so I reminded her and she comes back shortly with it. Only after we had been sitting there for ten minutes after we had finished everything and the busser, who was much friendly than our server, had already cleared the table, did our server appear from the darkness and we were finally able to get our check, pay, and leave. I'm used to the service being not so great, but this was just awful.\n\nI thought maybe if I wrote a review about my last experience, they'd change the service up or hire better servers. Serving itself isn't very hard, I know, I've done it. And it doesn't take much effort to check up on a table. But the people who work at The Pasty just don't seem to care about anything. I guess that's just a hipster thing. (I would love to see their interview process, if there even is one. \"Do you know how to carry food?\" \"Yes.\" \"Okay, you're hired.\")\n\nAnyway, I think I will be driving out of the way to go to the other Pasty instead. Since their servers are a little more attentive and I can actually see who I'm eating with, and what I'm eating for that matter. Hah, I can only imagine what that place looks like in the light. Maybe they keep it dark for a reason.\n\nIt's not like I'm expecting five star service or anything, I get that it's a bar too. But come on. If you're the type that doesn't like their server to stop by a lot, or you don't need any refills, then this place would be perfect for you.",

It's meant to be filling because the damn thing was invented for miners and as such, was never intended to be served with gravy.\n\nThings to know about the establishment itself:\n\n#1. It's dark inside for a reason - to mimic a mine, where the pasty was standard fare back in Britain, not because they're trying to be hipsters. The clientele does that.\n#2. The patio is smoker and pet friendly. Inside, the long tables and bench seats aren't particularly convenient for anyone with long legs or a rubenesque shape.\n\nReview:\n\nTried the Oggie for myself and a Porky for the little lady. She got a cup of the potato and leek soup and loved it. But with the full slice of bread it is served with, she couldn't eat the entire pasty herself. Both were quite delish, however.\n\nI was disappointed that the ONE beer (Hefeweizen) I was longing for out of the many fine selections on tap was \"out\". But, our waitress recommended I try a Hoegaarden instead. I requested a slice of orange added for good measure and found it to be an acceptable balance to the Oggie's heaviness.\n\nHonestly, I come from Wisconsin near the U.P. of Michigan and am partial to their style of pasty up in the Yoop. Not that what I had wasn't tasty, but the red wine gravy was a -- shall I say, unusual? -- flavor accompaniment. It's just a personal bias of mine.\n\nAnyone who has never had a pasty before will enjoy any selection on the menu.",

And I'm so glad we came! They were pretty busy at 8:30pm on a Saturday night. Walked in, sat ourselves, and a server showed up a couple minutes later to take our drink orders. I'd say they were a bit slow and not as attentive as I'd like but its more of a pub feel and they were pretty busy anyway. We ordered the Crispin hard ale to share and it was pretty tasty, not very sweet. I like how they have a large selection international beers (like King Fisher from India!) on their menu, its like you really are in an English pub!\n\nOur group got the Porky, Rosemary chicken, Lamb vindaloo, and chicken tikka masala pasties. We also ordered the broccoli and cauliflower bake and banana dessert. They were all good but I loved my lamb vindaloo, it was like actual lamb vindaloo that you would get at an Indian restaurant! Ironically the chicken tikka was my least favorite because it was too tomato-ey but it wasn't terrible. The yogurt sauce that came with complemented the pasty perfectly. \n\nThe broccoli cauliflower bake was delicious and cheesy, totally hit the spot on a cold night! The banoffe banana dessert was ok but I was disappointed that it was mostly whipped cream (unsweetened). The caramel, graham cracker crust and sliced bananas were still enough to carry on the dish. \n\nOverall great food, fun casual atmosphere ( saw LOTS of people on dates here) and totally worth checking out if you're in Tempe!",

Ever since my first visit, I have been hooked. I have learned to order one pasty for lunch, and get another to-go for later-- because knowing me, I will have a second craving during the day.\n\n  The first time I went I courageously tried their Chicken Tikka Masala pasty. My grandfather is from India, and I was raised on traditional Indian food, so I was a skeptic. However, their take on chicken masala (typically consisting of chicken, red curry, potatoes, vegetables and accompanied with rice) was impressive. There was just the right amount of curry to chicken to vegetable ratio, and I could not help but want to scarf it down. It was mild, so anyone could love it. Even their Vegetarian Tikka Masala pasty is delicious. As a former vegetarian and vegan, I am always skeptical when trying new meat substitutes, but the Quorn chicken substitute has a great consistency. \n \nAnother time I went, I tried their Shepherd's Pie Pasty, and declared that a victory. The pastry shell was crisp, the filling was flavorful, and the peas and carrots hadn't gone to mush. You can tell that they make the pasties (pastys?) fresh just by biting into them, but if you're not convinced, sit up at the bar and watch. \n\n  I will say, one of the best pasties they have is their Lovely Bit a Salmon. It took me a while to be able to order it because every time I tried, they were sold out (AND FOR GOOD REASONING!). I got lucky one unassuming Tuesday afternoon while ordering delivery for my mother, my roommate and myself. They were surprisingly prompt in their delivery and didn't seem to get lost with my crappy directions to my apartment. I ordered the Salmon, my mother the Pilgrim (SOOOO GOOD), and my roommate the Cheese Steak ( I didn't try his, but he said it was awesome). The Salmon pasty was heaven. I am not kidding- HEAVEN wrapped in a delicate pastry blanket and hand delivered from The Almighty Himself. The salmon was cooked to perfection, the dill sauce was mild, the asparagus still al dente, the potatoes were perfect, and the tomatoes and spinach were an added plus. \n\n My new favorite \"every-now-and-again\" pasty is The Peanut Butter and Jelly. HOLY GUACAMOLE! They have taken the traditional PB&J and slapped it in the face sent it home to it's momma. Then added some refinement, and some ooey-gooey, yummy in my tummy, goody-goody gumdrops to it. Holy Toledo. The banana is welcomed added bonus.  \n \nTo be honest, I have yet to try a pasty there that I do not like. This is a great thing, yet can be very unhelpful when trying to figure out what to have for lunch or dinner. \n\n Maybe someone can help me... I do not know what is in their salad dressing for their basic green salad... but it is AMAZING! \n Their garlic roasted potatoes and mushy peas are so yummy as well. \n\n They have my two drink requirements on tap: Guinness and Boddingtons. Also, they have Duvel which is one of my favorite Belgian beers for a moderate price. They have great Happy Hour drink specials including $3 car bombs. $3! YOU CAN'T BEAT THAT!\n\n Dine in, take out, or delivery. It doesn't matter how you get it, just GET IT! Make sure that if you order their green salad you get extra dressing--you will be happy that you did.",

Among the traditional pasties, you can't go wrong with the oggie, shepards pie or lamb and mint. I've tried the chicken tikka masala, greek chicken, and lamb vindaloo from the fancy schmancy options and they were just as stellar. The greek salad is also pretty respectable, with a hefty amount of kalamata olives and feta cheese. \n\nWatching the cooks at work is part of the fun at this place, so have a seat at the bar.

Finally made it back out to the tempe location and WOW, they renovated and definitely more room, and guess what ? yes Crowded still.. \n\nI have tried almost every Non-Vegetarian Pasty, and loved them ALL. \n\nFavorites are, Cheese Steak, Steak and cheese, Pepper Steak and the Adovada.. \n\n1 That i didn't like was a misplaced order on a very busy day and ended up somehow with shepherds pie pasty,, thinking that all the pasty's are great,, cant go wrong,, but should have known as i don't like any shepherds pie that it may be a bad call to keep it... lesson learned. \n\nWorking in area and hitting this place about once a week.\n\nKeep up the great work !!!\n\nOHHHH and the BEER..... great selection,, i suggest the RAJ IPA",

While many pub classics exist on their menu, I've yet to see a pasty on anyone else's menu, let alone one as good as the ones at Cornish. My personal favorite is the chicken rosemary, with a side of HP sauce. Oven chips are a good appetizer, since it'll be about 30-40 minutes before you get your food. Awesome selection of import beers. Service is good, even when busy. Only downside is that they feel a bit overpriced, considering how much side dishes cost and no combos are available. For two people ordering pasties, 2 beers, and two sides, expect to pay around forty or fifty after a tip and tax. That said, you'll leave full!",

The waitress told us that all are \"partially baked\".\n - My son asked if the Mexican was spicy and he was told only mildly.

The beer selection was pretty good, but my husband ordered beer in a bottle that the menu stated cost $6.50.  When the check came, it cost $10.

We realized that one of the pasties he brought out was not what we ordered.  It turns out he gave us the wrong order.  They all look the same on the outside, so how were we to know?

If you're up for eating a $10 Hot-Pocket-on-steroids, go to Cornish Pasty Company.\n \nThe veggie BBQ Spicy Chicken pasty was fun to eat. The homemade BBQ sauce was tangy, and the jalapeno and red onion stood out. I also ended up ordering a cheese plate and bowl of broccoli soup. I ate the soup too quickly and burned my tongue. What a disaster. The cheese plate was fine. The flavors were strong - sharp and or stinky was the name of the game. The plate came with pieces of toast, which was a lot of bread.

We had checked out the website and menu, so knew what we wanted to try.  \nFirst thing, in a lot of pictures, the place looks really cramped and small...wrong!   When you first walk in, there's a narrow hallway with a bar on one side and small 2-seat tables on the other.  But, if you walk around the corner, it opens up into a pretty large dining room (there's also a bar in here), as well as a nice sized patio.\nWe seated ourselves, and were immediately met by Hannah, our server.  She was friendly and made us feel welcome.  We perused the menu, but we both pretty much knew what we wanted.  \nI ordered \"The Pilgrim\" and my hubby ordered \"The Reuben\".  While we waited for our pasty's, we were able to enjoy the music playing.  Lots of our favorites, so the wait didn't seem like too long.  \n\"The Reuben\" is basically exactly what it sounds like...a reuben sandwich in a flaky wrap.  It was served with a side of 1000 island dressing.  My husband loved it, before I had a chance to ask for a bite...it was gone!!\n\"The Pilgrim\" is like a Thanksgiving dinner in a pasty.  It had roast chicken (during the holidays they serve it with roast turkey, but honestly, I couldn't tell the difference), sweet potatoes, stuffing and grilled onions.  It was served with a side of cranberry sauce.  OMG!!!  It was delicious and moist.  The chicken was so juicy.   Each bite reminded me of the day after Thanksgiving sandwiches...only this wasn't leftovers.  I devoured it!  My husband, who doesn't like stuffing, kept saying that when we go back, he's gonna order it.  Delicious!!!\nThe flakiness and flavor of the dough is wonderful.  Honestly, it's so moist and flavorful, you don't even need a sauce or condiment.  Most of the meals come with a red wine gravy on the side (and so did mine), but it definitely wasn't needed.  If I had ordered something with beef, it might have been a nice sauce to dunk a bite into, but like I said, it may not even be needed.\nWe're definitely going to make our way back to Tempe for another taste of a pasty, and there are a lot of very interesting ones on the menu.  We can't wait to try more!",

I don't know that I've had a reuben in the valley that's comparable to how amazing this pasty is.  And the oven chips?  Forget about it!  Not that you need a side with the size of the pasties...Oh, the Apple Caramel Pasty is also pretty top notch for dessert - warm and gooey.\n\nTheir craft beer selection is also admirable, with a few local drafts (including Four Peaks and Oak Creek) and plenty of English-themed brews and English IPAs.  Full disclosure: as a beer geek, I only wish they didn't serve the beer in a frosted glass...it kinda affects the flavor.  Besides that, there is nothing I can complain about, especially since they recently expanded into the building next door, thus gaining about 5X the seating and space.  Much more comfortable, less claustrophobic, and easier to get around.",

Thankfully, Cornish Pasty is lacking tassels and the like, simply serving up deliciously magical pockets filled with wonderful themed concoctions.  \n\nMy personal favorite is the reuben, where the pastrami and corned beef is tender, juicy and chewy at the same time, the buttery crust is perfectly flaky, and the 1000 Island dressing is something I enjoy smothering everything in.  I don't know that I've had a reuben in the valley that's comparable to how amazing this pasty is.  And the oven chips?  Forget about it!  Not that you need a side with the size of the pasties...Oh, the Apple Caramel Pasty is also pretty top notch for dessert - warm and gooey.\n\nTheir craft beer selection is also admirable, with a few local drafts (including Four Peaks and Oak Creek) and plenty of English-themed brews and English IPAs.  Full disclosure: as a beer geek, I only wish they didn't serve the beer in a frosted glass...it kinda affects the flavor.  Besides that, there is nothing I can complain about, especially since they recently expanded into the building next door, thus gaining about 5X the seating and space.  Much more comfortable, less claustrophobic, and easier to get around.",

Delicious food, comfortable atmosphere and late hours (serve food until midnight except for Sundays) is the reason my girlfriend and I frequent Cornish Pasty Co. The different kinds of pasties they offer are VERY diverse (anything from exotic flavors like the \"red curry chicken\" and \"lamb and mint\" to traditional flavors like \"italian\" and \"reuben\"). Of the 38+ flavors they offer, I have probably tried about 10 of them and haven't found one I didn't LOVE! I live 40 miles away form this location but never do I mind the drive, it's always worth it! I recommend the Carne Adovada and the Hibiscus tea is my favorite!",

I ordered the reuben pasty and it was good. The meat had a good flavor, some sauerkraut and the thousand island was brought on the side. The meal was a good size and left me satisfied - although I kept thinking about Sweeny Todd while eating the lunch.\n\nThe one downside I found with the restaurant is that we arrived near opening and even though we were the only two in the restaurant, the music was so loud that we could barely hear each other talk. Otherwise, it was a pleasant accidental finding.",

You can watch the guys cooking behind the bar.\nCleanliness: It was pretty clean and believe me I am always looking. There is 1 unisex bathroom, my hubby used it and said it was ok.\nFood: We ordered the Oogie (beef, potato, onion and rutabaga with red wine sauce) and the Pilgrim (turkey/chicken, stuffing, sweet potato with cranberry sauce on the side).  We split them. While good size they do not come with any other vegie, salad or garnish. These were priced at $6.50 and $8 respectively. I would never order the Oggie again because the beef was NOT tender! It was quite tough and the potato and rutabaga were undercooked. The Pilgrim said on the menu turkey/chicken but when I asked the waitress she said it was chicken. When I got it I saw that they use white and dark meat. The sweet potato was cut in small cubes and they seemed dry. It had a good flavor but just was not exciting enough to get me to go back.\nStaff: The waitress was friendly and didn't mind answering questions because it was our first time. My hubby had a soda and it never got refilled..she finally asked when left the bill.\nDrinks: Well, this is the best thing about the place! They have an excellent selection of beers and I got a 14 oz Kiltlifter for $3.50 a 20 oz wa only $1 more!! You can't beat that!\nConclusion: I probably would not go back unless it was just for a beer, but hey I can get beer a lot of places.",

Some late times at Time Out led me talking to a lady who works there, who told me of the Vegan Pasty one calls 45 minutes ahead of time. At 2am, with some amber bock, oh man, I was STOKED. I woke up the next morning, counting DOWN THE HOURS till I could dial that number for the vegan goodie. She recognized my voice, and I didnt have internet, so she was sweet enough to list the ingredients-I ended up getting eggplant and a bunch of other veggies. \n\nMy companion picked me up, and its on the HARDY side of the University and Hardy, fyi. We walked into a long, kind of dark hallway with small two seaters on the right and a bar on the left. Dude...were we in the right place? This place was SLEEK-black and white decor, clean, hip, I mean, like URBAN chic man, but not pretentious. Since it wasn't too buzy, we did the two-seater and she took our beer order (yummy beer selection-we did miss the happy hour at 5pm, but the prices were still fine), and ran into some friends. \n\nThe real star of this story is really the Pasty-I learned I could add some Quorn (the best meat substitute EVA), but that was ok. My food with some sauce was amazingly comforting. Not overly spiced, not overly cooked, loved the taters in it, I mean, there was nothing wrong with it-NOTHING. Like a shephards pie, or a pot pie, or a calzone, who doesn't love a warm fold...? Yeah? Yeah? This is the bomb. AND even though I was starving, I could barely finish it, but I felt perfectly content aftewards and not overstuffed at all. \n\nI even have their sticker on my CELL PHONE to advertise my love for this place-yeah, you heard right.

For my first trip to CPC, I chose the Tikka Masala pasty. It was pretty good! I guess I was hoping for a serving of spicy, somewhat creamy, and savory tikka masala served in a hot pocket. What I got was a good hot pocket full of chicken and some sauce. Not nearly has juicy and spicy as I had imagined it would be, but still good. I chose the peanut butter and jelly pasty for a dessert to take home with me. When I got home and baked it, I took a bite and it was peanut butter and apple jelly? I was confused. It was ok.\n\nOn my second trip to CPC, I had the cheeseburger pasty. That was pretty darn good! The meat was juicy and a little grease was dripping out of the pocket, which meant that it was nice and juicy! \n\nWhenever I am tempted by a hot pocket, I make sure that I head to CPC for a well made, tasty, more sophisticated version!",

The difference was, this steak was chewy and flavorless, I didn't taste any cheese, and there were more green peppers than any other ingredient.  The pastry part was good,  but undercooked.  \n\nI was excited that they had specific sauces to pair with each pasty.  The server allowed me to try both- a mustard one and a red wine one.  I found both to be gross and a terrible combination with the pasty. \n\nI just want to emphasize that I am not a picky eater and enjoy most food.

The waitress told us that all are \"partially baked\".\n - My son asked if the Mexican was spicy and he was told only mildly.

So if you don't like a certain ingredient or are allergic to something, there's no ordering the pasty of choice without it; you'll just have to find something without it in it.

I used to drive by the place all the time and my so at the time used to joke about Cornish Pastys being what Cornish strippers wore in non nude establishments.  All I can say is yum!\n\nSo one day, we took the plunge and stopped by after work.  It's dark but not dank.  Narrow but not crowded.  Tasty but not super fast.  Pasty may not be a good every day staple.  But it sure is tasty!  I have tried at least a half dozen menu items and none have steered me wrong but for the real \"flava\" I'm gonna recommend you stick with the more traditional stuff.  Otherwise you could just end up eating a calzone in disguise and seriously... who wants to eat a Cornish calzone?\n\nThe staff is nice, and friendly.  The vibe is decent and if you like meat (or veggies)  and potatoes (which may technically be a veggie but is class by itself you know) stuffed into delicous bread.  You will feel as if you have died and gone to heaven.\n\nDo not be fooled by cheap imitations! This is not some gussied up hot pocket or some savory pop tart! This is the real deal!  After eating this you'll be ready to go into a coal mine and work for .. well no. That may be stretching the truth.  But the food is really good.\n\nOne time, I preordered from this place and got a bunch of parbaked Pasties for a Christmas Eve celebration.  They were a big hit.",

We each picked a pasty of our choice and then split the mushy peas and roasted potatoes. Top it off with tapped hard cider and I was in oral heaven.\n\nThere was far too much food for two people to eat in one sitting. These little sandwiches are deceptively filling. And the incredible number of options from which to select from is a little mind boggling. My suggestion would be just to settle on one and then figure on a few return visits to round out the list.\n\nTables are tight, so this is definitely not a place to take the whole posse, but that's not a huge down-grade. The music is fairly loud and as I mentioned, I was there early, so I can only imagine that it must get really loud when the place is full. Amazingly, mom commented that she liked the music (who knew she was a Green Day fan) and thought the atmosphere was charming (not how I would have described it, but clearly its a place that is even parent friendly). She already has picked out her next two choices for return visits...\n\nA couple of things that really stood out to me: 1) You can get the Oggie (the basic pasty) partially cooked for a buck less than the menu price - then take it home and finish off the baking for that fresh out of the oven taste - very cool. 2) If you want desert, you have to order it first or share food, because there is no way to finish everything - sammie and side - and still want for more. 3) I've spent a lot of time in the mother land and don't remember the food every being this flavorful... but who really cares, this is good eats and did I mention the tapped hard cider??

            "text": "So my friends from ASU had mentioned this Irish pub place that served what was called a \"Pasty\". From the sound of things, it was a hot pocket/pie sandwich type deal. They mentioned an array of options from pepperoni to peppered steak etc. All that being said, decided we should go there for dinner the night before I left Arizona. Especially after I saw 860 reviews with 4.5 stars up here on yelp. That's virtually unreal. Never had seen such ratings with as many reviews. Any who, drove up to what looked like a dead shopping strip with a bunch of stores/restaurants that looked closed due to the dark tint of the windows. When we opened the door though, it was actually pretty mind blowing. Walked around from what I guess was the front door to the bar side. Honestly, first thing I thought coming around that corner was that this place looked like something off the set of man vs food. Can't really explain it but if you're familiar with the show and happen to make a stop, you'll understand what I'm saying. So we sat at the bar and got our orders. I wanted something spicy so I looked out for something that I thought would match my liking on the menu. Found the Cajun chicken pasty which was spicy marinated chicken, ham, bacon, with chipotle sauce. My girlfriend ordered the bangers mash which was mashed potatoes, meatloaf and gravy. My Cajun chicken was amazing. Spiced to perfection as was hoping. My girlfriends bangers mash was ok. Not as much flavor as my Cajun chicken but still pretty good. All in all, I would highly recommend this place. It definitely lives up to the 860 reviews and 4.5 stars, a rare occurrence. Only mishap, which really isn't a mishap, is that if you decide you want to add any custom pieces together in your pasty, we were told you would have to make such request 24hrs in advance. These guys make the sandwiches hours in advance so that it's just put into the oven upon order. So if you're the type to want to customize your order, I suggest you call in advance but you likely won't make the a wrong decision with any of the available options.",

Honestly, it's so moist and flavorful, you don't even need a sauce or condiment.  Most of the meals come with a red wine gravy on the side (and so did mine), but it definitely wasn't needed.  If I had ordered something with beef, it might have been a nice sauce to dunk a bite into, but like I said, it may not even be needed.\nWe're definitely going to make our way back to Tempe for another taste of a pasty, and there are a lot of very interesting ones on the menu.  We can't wait to try more!",

I'm cheap so spending $9+ on an entree with no sides seemed like it wouldn't be worth it - boy was I wrong. \nWe did have some difficulty trying to find the front door as its not right off the main road (Hardy) you have to go the parking lot and there you see a door with the business name and hours, which still didn't look like the right door. We walked in and felt like we came in a side door or something but a friendly gal said we could seat ourselves. \nThe place was pretty dark and looked like it had been there awhile which didn't bother us. We picked a two-top table which seemed like it was on a stage, we didn't want to take up the large community style (looking) tables.\nWe were promptly greeted by a sweet gal named Casey. She made us feel comfortable as we explained we hadn't been there before. My bf ordered a tea and they had three options (Hibiscus, black and green) he choose the green and said he liked it. I wanted an Odell Isolation but they said they ran out so I went with a Union Jack IPA (az local) and was pleasantly surprised by the price when we received our check that it was only $4, awesome deal! \nI normally eat vegan so I asked about the vegan pastie specials (two choices daily) They had quite a few vegan options on the menu (like 10) but all of them included a fake meat (Quorn brand) and I am not a fan of vegan food trying to be like \"normal\" food, just wanted veggies and nothing fake. She said one special was a \"Philly cheese steak style\" and the other was a spinach artichoke which sounded like what I wanted. My BF ordered the chicken pot pie one cause he knew that would be hard to mess up. He really enjoyed his, its what he was expecting - perfect and legit. \nMine arrived and I noticed mine looked different which I expected. I also noticed it had Daiya cheese on it which I wasn't expecting, I wish the server would have mentioned that cause I am not really a fan. To me Daiya has such a strong distinct flavor that it usually takes over whatever its on or in. This was no exception but I felt Like this time it was at least semi balanced where it didn't totally take it over but it was definitely a predominate taste. I know lots of vegans like that cheese but I'm a weirdo and would rather forgo fake cheese. \nHis crust was tasty since it had real butter and mine was a bit drier but still surprisingly good, even the boyfriend was stealing some from my plate.\nNext time I'm just gonna get a non vegan one so I can get the full experience, I really wanted to try a curry one (with no fake meat).\nOverall awesome experience and when u are there you feel like you are in a place of history, even if you are not - I am not sure ;)",

These puff pastry stuffed bundles of heaven erupt with surgically precise flavor combinations that leave me speechless every single time. \n\nMy new favorite is the Lamb & Mint, a delicious combination of succulent and juicy lamb, perfectly sliced potatoes, rutabaga, and of course, the fresh mint sprigs make for a truly transcendental dining experience. \n\nAfter tasting more than 3/4 of their menu, I have yet to taste a single thing that wasn't perfectly cooked, perfectly spiced, or perfectly paired with their exquisite red wine gravy. I could drink that delicious concoction by the gallon. \n\nThe vegetarian pasties are undeniably good as well, the Eggplant Parmesan is a worldly experience that I could eat any time, any day. It stuffs the best bits of the garden into a mozzarella, marinara and Parmesan wrapped envelope of goodness that has to be tasted to be appreciated.\n\nThe Cream of Leek, Potato and Stilton Cheese soup is out of this world, the Garlic & Herb Roasted Red Mashed Potatoes with Cheese make all other mashed potato dishes taste like dehydrated flake garbage, and the desserts (if you can find any more room in your belly for awesome) are the food of gods. The PB&J Pasty or the Banoffee Pie make me want to live in this restaurant until the day I die.\n\nThe location is being renovated currently to expand into the adjacent building, which is a welcomed change as the intimate dining area admittedly cramped on busy days. Though it is a wondrous experience to watch the staff prepare their pasties mere feet from your seat, it will really do well to have a few more tables. Sit at the bar if at all possible for the best dining experience.\n\nI wish I could give CPC 6 stars simply because the other places I've deemed worthy of 5 stars simply cannot compare. On top of all this, the unparalleled drinking specials, 32 oz steins, and $3 car bombs every day make this not only a wonderful place to eat, but a perfect spot to pickle the liver as well.",

So far I've tried The Rosemary Chicken, The Pepper Steak, The Pesto Chicken, and The Mexican, I'd say The Rosemary Chicken was my favorite, but it really depends on what kind of mood you're in, there's really no way you can go wrong with any order...hey anything with that much butter in the crust could never be bad!!! ;)\n\nThe only thing I would change about this place is the happy hour.  A dollar off drinks doesn't really blow my skirt up.  Maybe some food specials???

            "text": "All my life I thought the Irish were responsible for rainbows. Fantasies of red-bearded drunks dancing in shamrock fields with pots of gold had always accompanied the notorious rainbow in my childhood imagination. Then, I assumed the gays stole it. I was wrong. The Cornish own the rainbow. Let me explain:\n \nI became stranded in the Arizona desert when my Pinto got not one, but four flat tires. (Hit a hot speed bump and the tires melted right off.) I realized that I didn't have any food or water. At that moment, I knew I'd be fighting for my life.\n\nMy heart began to race. I was on the verge of having a panic attack. I had to settle myself down. I took a few deep breaths and knew what I needed--smooth jazz. I turned the radio to 95.5 KYOT (The Valley's original smooth jazz station). I couldn't believe my ears. Coolio's \"Gangsta's Paradise\" was blaring through my speakers. Projectile vomit shot out my mouth. Had my entire childhood been sold down the dry canal? I thought God was playing a sick trick on me. I shuffled through radio stations faster than old people shuffle board (i.e. I took my time). But, it was true. Thee \"Coyote\" sold out.\n\nAll hope had been lost. My spirit was shattered, and the little moisture I had left was now a soggy puddle in the passenger's seat. I was in a dire situation. In desperation, I checked between the seat cushions hoping to find some crumbs to eat but, instead, found a few petrified McDonald french fries. I looked at them and thought to myself: \"I'd rather eat pigeon crap.\" I flicked the fries out of my Pinto. I used my finger to write a goodbye message on the dirt-crusted windshield and began my trek across the arid valley. \n\nAs far as I could see, nothing but cacti and cheap Mexican food restaurants. The little vegetation was riddled with thorns and bore no fruit. The thought of a carne asada burrito tempted me like a mirage, but I knew the explosive diarrhea I'd get would dry me out quicker than a sponge in the sun. I had to stay strong and keep going. \n\nAfter four long minutes of walking, I gave up. The sun leached my energy and exhausted all remaining calories. The horizon held no signs of hope. Just signs for Filiberto's, Amado's, Los Favorito's, Armando's, Pedrito's, and Taco Bell. My pasty skin was turning pink and my balls looked like raisins, so I sat in the shade of a palo verde tree and prayed. I begged God not to let me die. I repented for my sins. I promised that if he let me live I'd never do anything bad ever again. \n\nThen, out of the blue, I felt drops of wetness on my bald scalp. I looked up to the sky and saw that a pigeon was dropping deuces from the branch above. (I guess He wasn't too fond of me flicking french fries onto the desert ground.) God trickled the sign I was begging for right on my forehead, and now He was putting me to the test. If I wanted to be saved, I'd have to eat pigeon deux. So, I bowed my head, placed my palms together, and said grace. \n\nThere was a trembling rumble that echoed across the desert, and it wasn't the sound of me regurgitating. As I stood up from the gravel to peer into the abyss of newly formed clouds, a surge of water swept my legs out from under me. Before I knew it, I was being carried away in a flash flood. \n\nMy next memory was waking to the sound of chirping birds. I flinched and covered my face fearing that I may be lying under another pigeon-riddled palo verde. I opened my eyes and was blinded by colors. I didn't know what was going on. Vibrant reds, yellows, and blues! I had no idea where I was. I got so scared, I pooped a Skittle. Then, it hit me. You know when people say that it's impossible to reach the end of the rainbow? It's a lie. It's at the entrance of a mystical place called Cornish Pasty. \n\nI entered the land of the Cornish and it was like no place I'd ever been. I expected leprechauns but encountered a species far more enchanting, with skins of the finest tapestries and earlobes so large and peculiar that they could double as tire swings. Apparently, I wasn't the first person to reach the End of the Rainbow, because this place was packed tighter than a carton of cigarettes. I tracked down one of these Cornish creatures and told her my story, explaining how famished I was. She was unusually polite and let me sit in her earlobe until a seat opened up at a table. I swung around the restaurant as she went from table to table, filling mugs up with magically frothy beer. Then, I whispered in her ear: \"Are there pots of gold here?\" A spot at a table had opened up, and she sat me down. She told me that she'd be right back. \n\nI sketched pictures of these Cornish creatures as I waited. The troll returned and placed a dish in front of me. She gave me a wink, then walked away. I grabbed the warm pocket of food that rested on the metal dish before me, stuffed it in my mouth, and died.\n\nIt was gold, my friends.",

At the end of the 3rd day, I had seen enough food to feed the LSU National champion football team.  I could out fast Les or Bear on their survivor shows\n\nDinner time was approaching.....My business associate and I couldn't face a full course dinner for at least another 24 hours...but we knew we had to eat something so we wouldnt wake up at 3 am famished.  I remembers reading about this place in Yelp that would be perfect for our situation....so remembering some favorable Yelp reviews in Phoenix  I said to him:\n\n\"How about pastys for dinner?\"\n\nHe went from a relaxed and carefree disposition to a stunned and shocked demeanor.   He looked me like I was from another planet and his glance indicated doubt about my integrity.   Then with a delayed but dry smile he spoke up and said....\n\n\"Aren't those things they wear at the.....\"\n\n\"NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!    Not pasties......pastys.\"   I retorted quickly before the people in the lobby heard the next nouns he was just about to utter.   \"Pasty's with a short vowel, not long.   Have you ever had one.?\"\n\nStill thinking of the long vowel version, he hesitated a little and answered with a \"No\" veiled with a lot of doubt and concern.\n\n\"Good.   That's where we're going.\"    As I glanced over to him, I could see a sense of curiousity, dispair and expectation of upcoming chaos.\n\nWe arrived at 7:45 pm.   It's dark everywhere.   In the street, in the parking lot.   We enter the restaurant and it's no brighter.   \n\nIt is a very narrow and long restaurant with just enough room for seats at the bar nearly the length of the store and small side tables on the side.  The interior decoration theme is obvious here.   Build the biggest bar that would fit in this row house type of store, and accessorize the rest of the restaurant around the bar.  \n\nSitting in a very dark restaurant, with Beatle music blaring away, this English pub type of place had a huge variety of pastys....from traditional steak and potatoes, to bangers and mash, to more contempory selections that include vegetarian, curries, and fish.   They have a huge selection of international beers, many of which are of the UK......duhhh.\n\nI wanted to eat \"light\" so I selected the Lovely Bit a Salmon which is\nAtlantic Salmon in a white wine cream & dill sauce, sauted asparagus, spinach, roasted red potatoes, spinach and roasted tomatoes. \n\nWHAT A GREAT DISH.   Everything was layered carefully inside the pasty which was served cut in half.  The salmon was cooked perfectly.  The asparagus was not over cooked but had a crunch.   All the flavors blended well together.   I still wasn't hungry so I took one half of it back to the hotel....and had it for breakfast the following morning......which tasted just great.\n\nMy buddy had Spicy Asiago Chicken which was spicy chicken, roasted corn, black beans, asiago cheese, hatch chilies, and Mexican stewed tomatoes with a side of sour cream & salsa.

It felt a bit like dining in a mineshaft, which seems to be the place to munch on Cornish Pasties.\n\nWe stopped by here on our way out of Phoenix back to CA, lured by the proximity to our hotel and the good reviews.  The pasties are substantial - my wife only finished half of hers. There's a variety of fillings - I had the bangers and mash, my wife an Indian curry. Both were tasty if a bit salty. We stayed full most of the trip back to the coast.  The server was friendly and efficient; our drinks never reached bottom before being refilled.\n\nWe'll likely come back next time we're in town.",

At first I tried to ignore it, but eventually curiosity got the best of me. So many rave reviews about this  'glorified hot pocket'. I'm thinking, yes I like hot pockets, but I don't know if I could take that affinity to the restaurant level. \n\nCornish Pasty Company happened to be literally less than a mile from our hotel so we had to check it out. We got there right before the dinner rush and barely waited for a seat at the bar. I decided on the chicken tikka masala and the bf got the peppered steak. He was intrigued by the bleu cheese. We were both happy with our orders. There is a decent wait from the time you order, but just think of every minute going towards a perfectly baked pasty. Now I understand how people can compare it to a hot pocket. This is the epitome of hot pockets and I can't find the words to a description that justifies how good it is. \n\nOur waitress and the kitchen guy we chatted up were both suuuper nice. The waitress was very attentive and quick. The place itself is pretty dark (literally, dim lighting) and has that euro dive bar feel to it. I enjoyed sitting at the bar, feeling like a local and watching the kitchen staff work those ovens. \n\nThe food alone would have gotten me to love them. To top it off, they have THREE DOLLAR irish car bombs!!! Their receipt even says \"IRISH CAR BOMB... F... YEAH\" haha, they definitely know what's up. \n\nNo doubt I'll be back for more the next time I'm in the area.",

(Bangers and mash and italian were my favorite). I tried all 4 the night I bought them, when they were hot and fresh. \n* They were a little dry (particularly the lamb ones), and it would have been nice to have some sauce INSIDE the pasty (maybe that makes them soggy though?)\n* The red wine sauce was really good, but was a little salty when I added enough to help with the dryness. \n\nThe Bad: \n* None! Maybe the price is a little high? almost $10 seems a little high... but overall, I was happy. \n\nI will happily go back when stocking up on a few days worth of food.",

The place is usually dark & loud, which is definitely the atmosphere of this place (modeled to sorta feel like an old mine, without the coal dust). If you're looking for a brighter quieter place go to the library. Their pastys are freaking amazing. I think we've tried about 10 of them on the menu so far & our favorites are the Pilgrim & Roast dinner. The Pilgrim comes with a cranberry sauce that is super delicious with a red wine gravy style sauce that is also super delicious! The Roast Dinner comes with a creamy white sauce (still not sure what it is) and a red wine gravy sauce. We also like to get the sticky toffee pudding for dessert, if they have any available. If you like sweet super moist, rich, sorta carry desserts definitely try this. They some times serve it with ice cream, sometimes just cream, sometime both. The most recent time we were there we had both and it was so delicious (I think I like sticky toffee pudding with ice cream the best because it helps to cool it down & makes it even more sweet, but not sickly or overwhelmingly sweet). The only downside is the last two times we've come in they are out of hot tea. This time they were out of lemonade, but were able to 'find a tea bag in the back'. A British style restaurant out of tea? If this was London they would riot. This food is always delicious, atmosphere is unique, service can be a bit slow sometimes (that's because they're always busy in the evenings when we come), and bring a bag of tea just in case.",

It took almost 20 minutes and the pasty tasted like someone tried to smoke me out of my house with a Rosemary bush. And the coleslaw description should read \"cabbage mixed with mayo, shredded and scooped with the cup it's served in\" It was inedible and when we told the bartender she did take actually it off the check which was good. The fries were good, but not good enough to come back for. \n\nOn top of everything else, I feel like they keep the lights low for a reason. Everything did have a certain dinge to it.\n\nWon't be back.",

Fantasies of red-bearded drunks dancing in shamrock fields with pots of gold had always accompanied the notorious rainbow in my childhood imagination. Then, I assumed the gays stole it. I was wrong. The Cornish own the rainbow. Let me explain:\n \nI became stranded in the Arizona desert when my Pinto got not one, but four flat tires. (Hit a hot speed bump and the tires melted right off.) I realized that I didn't have any food or water. At that moment, I knew I'd be fighting for my life.\n\nMy heart began to race. I was on the verge of having a panic attack. I had to settle myself down. I took a few deep breaths and knew what I needed--smooth jazz. I turned the radio to 95.5 KYOT (The Valley's original smooth jazz station). I couldn't believe my ears. Coolio's \"Gangsta's Paradise\" was blaring through my speakers. Projectile vomit shot out my mouth. Had my entire childhood been sold down the dry canal? I thought God was playing a sick trick on me. I shuffled through radio stations faster than old people shuffle board (i.e. I took my time). But, it was true. Thee \"Coyote\" sold out.\n\nAll hope had been lost. My spirit was shattered, and the little moisture I had left was now a soggy puddle in the passenger's seat. I was in a dire situation. In desperation, I checked between the seat cushions hoping to find some crumbs to eat but, instead, found a few petrified McDonald french fries. I looked at them and thought to myself: \"I'd rather eat pigeon crap.\" I flicked the fries out of my Pinto. I used my finger to write a goodbye message on the dirt-crusted windshield and began my trek across the arid valley. \n\nAs far as I could see, nothing but cacti and cheap Mexican food restaurants. The little vegetation was riddled with thorns and bore no fruit. The thought of a carne asada burrito tempted me like a mirage, but I knew the explosive diarrhea I'd get would dry me out quicker than a sponge in the sun. I had to stay strong and keep going. \n\nAfter four long minutes of walking, I gave up. The sun leached my energy and exhausted all remaining calories. The horizon held no signs of hope. Just signs for Filiberto's, Amado's, Los Favorito's, Armando's, Pedrito's, and Taco Bell. My pasty skin was turning pink and my balls looked like raisins, so I sat in the shade of a palo verde tree and prayed. I begged God not to let me die. I repented for my sins. I promised that if he let me live I'd never do anything bad ever again. \n\nThen, out of the blue, I felt drops of wetness on my bald scalp. I looked up to the sky and saw that a pigeon was dropping deuces from the branch above. (I guess He wasn't too fond of me flicking french fries onto the desert ground.) God trickled the sign I was begging for right on my forehead, and now He was putting me to the test. If I wanted to be saved, I'd have to eat pigeon deux. So, I bowed my head, placed my palms together, and said grace. \n\nThere was a trembling rumble that echoed across the desert, and it wasn't the sound of me regurgitating. As I stood up from the gravel to peer into the abyss of newly formed clouds, a surge of water swept my legs out from under me. Before I knew it, I was being carried away in a flash flood. \n\nMy next memory was waking to the sound of chirping birds. I flinched and covered my face fearing that I may be lying under another pigeon-riddled palo verde. I opened my eyes and was blinded by colors. I didn't know what was going on. Vibrant reds, yellows, and blues! I had no idea where I was. I got so scared, I pooped a Skittle. Then, it hit me. You know when people say that it's impossible to reach the end of the rainbow? It's a lie. It's at the entrance of a mystical place called Cornish Pasty. \n\nI entered the land of the Cornish and it was like no place I'd ever been. I expected leprechauns but encountered a species far more enchanting, with skins of the finest tapestries and earlobes so large and peculiar that they could double as tire swings. Apparently, I wasn't the first person to reach the End of the Rainbow, because this place was packed tighter than a carton of cigarettes. I tracked down one of these Cornish creatures and told her my story, explaining how famished I was. She was unusually polite and let me sit in her earlobe until a seat opened up at a table. I swung around the restaurant as she went from table to table, filling mugs up with magically frothy beer. Then, I whispered in her ear: \"Are there pots of gold here?\" A spot at a table had opened up, and she sat me down. She told me that she'd be right back. \n\nI sketched pictures of these Cornish creatures as I waited. The troll returned and placed a dish in front of me. She gave me a wink, then walked away. I grabbed the warm pocket of food that rested on the metal dish before me, stuffed it in my mouth, and died.\n\nIt was gold, my friends.",

Since I didn't know what kind of sauce to order with it, Justin brought me three different ones. Red wine gravy, peppercorn sauce and some mustard cream sauce.  As it turned out, they were all great but the peppercorn was my favorite. I gotta tell you, the pasty was great. though I have no previous pasty experience, I can say that this pasty was terrific, the service was great and I will be going back.",

I got the philly cheesesteak which the waiter informed was nothing like an actual philly cheesesteak.  As far as my experience goes, they include steak, cheese, mushrooms, peppers- all of which were also in the pasty.  The difference was, this steak was chewy and flavorless, I didn't taste any cheese, and there were more green peppers than any other ingredient.  The pastry part was good,  but undercooked.  \n\nI was excited that they had specific sauces to pair with each pasty.  The server allowed me to try both- a mustard one and a red wine one.  I found both to be gross and a terrible combination with the pasty. \n\nI just want to emphasize that I am not a picky eater and enjoy most food.  I was extremely disappointed that I spent money there.  Neither me nor my coworker finished our food and the waiter looked at us oddly when we didn't want to take the rest to go. No thanks.

We thought the place would be larger, its a little small, but that's ok. It felt like we were in a British pub, and I've been dying to go to London. No, but seriously, the atmosphere is really cool and very original. Service as well as the staff here are very friendly and really cool.\n\nI don't drink, but the prospect of getting to choose from tons of locally brewed and imported beer is appealing. We ended up ordering a cheese steak pasty and a chicken tikka masala pasty. I was extremely skeptical and thought I was going to be in for a big disappointment. What business did this British pub even have THINKING about chicken tikka masala? To my surprise, I think I just tasted the BEST CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA IN PHOENIX. Hold up, Cornish Pasty Company, a BRITISH type PUB HAS THE BEST CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA in PHOENIX. I know, you must think I'm nuts, but I'm Indian and I thoroughly enjoyed this amazing interpretation of a stereotypical Indian dish. The tikka masala overshadowed the cheesesteak which I thought was rather bland. I think the issue here was that the chicken tikka was so overwhelmingly awesome. I can't wait to go back and have the tikka masala again and perhaps try something else.\n\nEverything here is super fresh, you can see them making the pasties and dough and everything. The pasties have a perfect texture and are golden brown on the outside. If you're unsure of what a pasty is, it is basically a chicken bake or calzone, but with different fillings. Really awesome.\n\nIt'd be awesome if the owner of this place decided to get a few TVs, then it'd be even more pub like. Also,  it'd be super duper awesome if he decided to pick up some English Premier League games on the weekends. I would most definitely come down for some breakfast pasties and watch a few games.",

I guess they prefer a total BAR atmosphere ! After surveying the menu for 15 minutes I decided on the Philly Cheese Steak Pastie and my friend went traditional with the Shepherds Pie.\nLet me say we were NOT disappointed, the Pasties were fresh and yummy delicious, mine came with a mustard cream sauce as well as their red wine gravy that I had asked for. I prefer the gravy ! My friends Shepherds Pie with Lamb and the wine gravy was also yummy. After a short walk around I was surprised to see all of these wonderful pie's were being made FRESH behind a short order/bar environment. Yes just like we used to see in the drug stores, a griddle and gas fired 4 burner stove and a tiny convection oven If you've never had a pastie, its basically like a calzone but uses a pastry crust. There were over 25 different variations with several great looking desserts, we decided on the homemade bread pudding, more chocolate brownie tasting then traditional bread pudding, but tasty all the same.\nThere prices were fair for the Tempe area, $9.50 and $9.75 respectively and the bread pudding was $7.50.\nI am looking forward to dining there again when they are not out of their homemade sausage.\nIf you don't care for a Bar atmosphere, loud music, dark and dingy then you should steer clear or set outside.\nI should add that I found it extremely odd that they used old church pews for a large part of their seating.",

I informed her that we were leaving because she took 30 minutes to get to us. She should have just let us leave and not say anything. The fact she even acknowledged she was a crappy waitress enraged me more.\n\nSo why the three stars? When you're not waiting FOREVER for service and you actually get the opportunity to eat their pasties, your mind will be blown! The food is delicious!

As it turned out, the pasty was deceptively small looking and was actually incredibly hearty. I could barely finish it and I had hardly any of the fries. Sides really aren't necessary!\n\nThe major downside, and the reason for 4 stars, is the rather uncomfortable interior. I don't really mind that it's dark or grungy, but my main complaint was how loud it was. The music was so loud, my dinner mates and I could barely carry on a conversation since we had to basically shout to be heard. I suppose if you're drinking and being loud anyway it's not too bad, but otherwise it's not the best place to actually eat there. In the future I'll stick to take out.",

            "text": "I am reviewing the original Tempe location.  Given all the great reviews this place has gotten, I was wondering what I could add that hasn't already been said.  It's not only the only place in Tempe you can get a cornish pasty, but they are also freak'n awesome.  The Lovely Bit of Salmon was my favorite, but alas given my newly discovered gluten intolerance I am not able to part-take in such loveliness any more:  :(\n\nBut nevertheless, I still come here every now and then with my friends and husband.  They all chow down on the yummy pasties while I chow down on my salads, sides, and soups.  So, I decided to concentrate my review on those items. (Some of these dishes are not gluten free.  I had them before I found out about my gluten intolerance.) \n\nSoups:\nThey offer a variety of soups.  I have tried: 1) the cream of leek, potato, and stilton, 2) the cream of tomato and crouton, and 3) the red pepper, black bean, rice, chicken, and jalapeno.  They were all very good, but I was informed that only the red pepper one is gluten free.  I had the first two before I found out about my gluten intolerance.  Not only are their soups really tasty, full of flavor, they are all also accompanied by thick slices of fresh bread and butter, baked and churned in-house.  Absolutely delicious!  The are perfect accompaniments, and a bowl at $4.75 would make a tasty and light lunch that won't break the bank.  \n\nSides: \nThe garlic mashed potatoes and the garlic roasted potatoes are also very good.  Pretty much what you should expect.  Creamy mashed potatoes and nicely roasted red potatoes with a hint of garlic.  Not too garlicky.  \n\nThe mushy peas is one of my favorite side dishes that they serve.  I think I prefer them to the potatoes simply because they are something different that I can't get anywhere else.  And these ain't  no ordinary peas.  They are huge for peas.  Cooked really well.  Not too mushy (overcooked), even though they are \"mushy\" peas. There is a great texture and freshness to this dish.  The texture of these \"mushy peas\" is more like crunchy peanut butter than creamy peanut butter if we were speaking of peanut butter that is (it's an analogy. . . just go with it), and I think the freshness and the texture go hand in hand from not overcooking the peas.  \n\nThe broccoli and cauliflower cheese bake is also a nice dish.  It makes me think of mac'n cheese, but with cauliflower and broccoli instead of mac noodles.  I dont think this dish is gluten free.  It seems to be made with a cheese sauce that is thickened with a flour rue, then baked to give a nice golden, crusted top.  It was tasty as well, but could have used a bit more seasoning.  It was my least favorite of all the sides I have had. \n\nAll their salads are also pretty good.  The veggies in the salad are pretty much the same regardless of which salad you get: ice berg lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and onions.  Except for the Greek and pasta.  The Greek has feta and olives, and the pasta has a whole list of its own ingredients.  \n\nWhat differentiates the various salads are the additions and the dressing.  Beside the basic garden and Greek, the three other salads to choose from are: 1) the salmon or chicken caesar, 2) the chicken tikka salad, and 3) the sausage salad.  The salmon caesar is a great substitute for the Lovely Bit of Salmon pasty.  The salmon is cooked very well.  Juicy, not overcooked and not undercooked, seasoned just like the salmon in the Lovely Bit of Salmon.  Ask for a side of the white wine and dill dressing that usually accompanies the Lovely Bit of Salmon and you will not regret it.  That sauce is amazing.  This is my favorite salad. The chicken tikka is also good.  The chicken is marinated in a red rub or spice, like what you would find with tandoori chicken, and served on a salad with yogurt dressing.  Finally, the sausage salad was not my favorite.  They make the sausage in house, but I was a bit disappointed with the flavor and the way it was cooked.  It was overcooked, very dry, and a bit off.  I'm not sure if I would order it again.  I've had it twice and it was the same both times.\n\nOverall, this is one of the best restaurants in Tempe!",

One of my favorites is the Veggie Rosemary Chicken (or non veggie version too). The sides (oven roasted potatoes) and salads are great too.

We each picked a pasty of our choice and then split the mushy peas and roasted potatoes. Top it off with tapped hard cider and I was in oral heaven.\n\nThere was far too much food for two people to eat in one sitting. These little sandwiches are deceptively filling. And the incredible number of options from which to select from is a little mind boggling. My suggestion would be just to settle on one and then figure on a few return visits to round out the list.\n\nTables are tight, so this is definitely not a place to take the whole posse, but that's not a huge down-grade. The music is fairly loud and as I mentioned, I was there early, so I can only imagine that it must get really loud when the place is full. Amazingly, mom commented that she liked the music (who knew she was a Green Day fan) and thought the atmosphere was charming (not how I would have described it, but clearly its a place that is even parent friendly). She already has picked out her next two choices for return visits...\n\nA couple of things that really stood out to me: 1) You can get the Oggie (the basic pasty) partially cooked for a buck less than the menu price - then take it home and finish off the baking for that fresh out of the oven taste - very cool. 2) If you want desert, you have to order it first or share food, because there is no way to finish everything - sammie and side - and still want for more. 3) I've spent a lot of time in the mother land and don't remember the food every being this flavorful... but who really cares, this is good eats and did I mention the tapped hard cider??

It's tucked between a discount bread store and an Italian place in a slightly run down little strip mall. Initially, when you walk in it doesn't get much better... Its a hallway basically with about 8 tables that seat 2, 2 tables that seat four and a table all the way in the back that will seat 6-8. They also have about 14 seats at the bar.

So, BASICALLY we've never been disappointed. \n\nAnd the red wine gravy that they serve on the side... Yeah, I could drink it (you will want to too). \n\nAnd while there are a TON of pastys to choose from... at least once you have to order their pasta salad (order it w/ chicken). Spinach, bow tie pasta, grape tomatoes, kalamata olives, onions, artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers and chicken tossed in a yummy pesto vinaigrette.\n\nThis is a spot that we always hit early on a Sat or Sun... rarely are we interested in braving the Fri night crowd... And, don't go with more than 4 people unless you want to sit at the bar.\n\nHard Cider and a pasty... my perfect Sunday afternoon.\n\n*I was torn on giving the CPC 4 or 5 stars because of their ti-ny seating capacity... but it adds to the character of the place.",

It's pronounced \"pass-tee.\" \n\nPasties are a traditional lunch food for miners from Cornwall in the UK. They go back hundreds of years, and you can read the menu to learn all about that. Dean, the founder, head chef and all-around professor of pasties, will be happy to add even more, being the good Cornish lad he is. \n\nNow, there are a bunch of things I like about CoPaCo. First, the pasties range from the traditional to the totally off-the-wall. The recipes are so varied, from the Royal with Cheese to the Lamb Vindaloo and the Lovely Bit of Salmon, that I can't even pick a favorite. If I go there 10 different times, I'll eat ten different pasties. They're hand-made each day, including the dough. The kitchen crew at this place proves humans built the pyramids - these guys work their tales off keeping the pasties coming, and they make Amish barn raisers look lazy.\n\nSecond, it's just a fun place. There's usually good, hard rock 'n' roll playing over the sound system. It's a place where you can have some ribald antics and loud laughter and nobody cares. It's laid-back and unpretentious. The staff is courteous, though they can get a bit harried during the busy hours. But they'll always try their hardest and be friendly.\n\nThird, there are some great desserts. The bonofee pie (graham cracker crust, whipped cream, bananas, caramel!) is my favorite.\n\nWhat could be better? Eh, I'd ditch the taps that disgorge Kronenburg 1664 and Hoegaarden and drop in a fewer higher-octane brews. In the meantime, the cooler is full of bottled selections. The Skull Splitter is awesome!\n\nKeep in mind that even though I gave it five stars, this is not a fancy, high-falutin' sort of place. It's absolutely perfect for what it is: a fun place to gather with your hooligan sidekicks, eat creative twists on the Cornish pasty and listen to some rock music. Brilliant!",

But here you are with this place that blows away anything you would find in Britain that's for sure.  This place has a very eclectic atmosphere that's about the only was to describe it.  IT's got this very long bar area that goes along two rooms and the center of the bar area is actually the kitchen where there a handful of people making these pies all into the night.  I think I was there close to 12pm once and they were still making and baking these pies.  It's actually fun to watch.  The place is dark and loud so if that's not your thing than you might not be a fan but I love it.  All the pies I've had are really good and they do make a least 2 vegan options but they do run out sometimes so just be prepared.  There are also a very large amount of vegetarian pies with fake chicken and meats.  I had an Indian Vindaloo one that was really good and had a nice spicy kick.  All of the pies will come with a side of sauce for dipping and it really ads flavor to every bite.  The service here is top notch considering all the people and commotion of people making pies around them.  The people who come here are all pretty social especially in the bar area.  I've had people buy me drinks here because they are being friendly. Speaking of drinks they have a great beer and wine menu and it's reasonably priced.  Overall this is a place is a must try if you are in the area.",

I thought the black lace curtains were especially creepy. Old church pew benches need some serious upholstery work. The glass light over our table was broken and dusty. it wasn't one of the newer fixtures but one of the old ones that hangs just above eye level. all this accentuated with some very deep hard 70s and 80s rock music with some pretty amazing guitar riffs but very odd for a restaurant. The restrooms during our visit were completely ignored by the staff as they were dirty, and unattended for probably hours in a busy restaurant. They are also ignored by the owners and managers because of broken fixtures like paper towel and TP dispensers bad paint and lighting and a lot of graffiti.\n\nService was ok, took orders brought food, that's it. there were 11 empty glasses on the table when our party of 4 left. Maybe managers can find a better way to get a side of lemon slices to the table as mine arrived on a plastic drink lid.\n\nThe bacon wrapped meatballs arrived hot and greasy, they tasted fine, but I had to re think my salad order when I notice only 3 poorly chopped pieces of browning romaine lettuce that was used to garnish under the caldron that held the meatballs.\n\nAll of the pasties looked smaller then I remember and so was my Greek salad, Maybe I am just spoiled by the \"Scottsdale\" location but the salad bowl was tiny and deep and chipped.

            "text": "I am reviewing the original Tempe location.  Given all the great reviews this place has gotten, I was wondering what I could add that hasn't already been said.  It's not only the only place in Tempe you can get a cornish pasty, but they are also freak'n awesome.  The Lovely Bit of Salmon was my favorite, but alas given my newly discovered gluten intolerance I am not able to part-take in such loveliness any more:  :(\n\nBut nevertheless, I still come here every now and then with my friends and husband.  They all chow down on the yummy pasties while I chow down on my salads, sides, and soups.  So, I decided to concentrate my review on those items. (Some of these dishes are not gluten free.  I had them before I found out about my gluten intolerance.) \n\nSoups:\nThey offer a variety of soups.  I have tried: 1) the cream of leek, potato, and stilton, 2) the cream of tomato and crouton, and 3) the red pepper, black bean, rice, chicken, and jalapeno.  They were all very good, but I was informed that only the red pepper one is gluten free.  I had the first two before I found out about my gluten intolerance.  Not only are their soups really tasty, full of flavor, they are all also accompanied by thick slices of fresh bread and butter, baked and churned in-house.  Absolutely delicious!  The are perfect accompaniments, and a bowl at $4.75 would make a tasty and light lunch that won't break the bank.  \n\nSides: \nThe garlic mashed potatoes and the garlic roasted potatoes are also very good.  Pretty much what you should expect.  Creamy mashed potatoes and nicely roasted red potatoes with a hint of garlic.  Not too garlicky.  \n\nThe mushy peas is one of my favorite side dishes that they serve.  I think I prefer them to the potatoes simply because they are something different that I can't get anywhere else.  And these ain't  no ordinary peas.  They are huge for peas.  Cooked really well.  Not too mushy (overcooked), even though they are \"mushy\" peas. There is a great texture and freshness to this dish.  The texture of these \"mushy peas\" is more like crunchy peanut butter than creamy peanut butter if we were speaking of peanut butter that is (it's an analogy. . . just go with it), and I think the freshness and the texture go hand in hand from not overcooking the peas.  \n\nThe broccoli and cauliflower cheese bake is also a nice dish.  It makes me think of mac'n cheese, but with cauliflower and broccoli instead of mac noodles.  I dont think this dish is gluten free.  It seems to be made with a cheese sauce that is thickened with a flour rue, then baked to give a nice golden, crusted top.  It was tasty as well, but could have used a bit more seasoning.  It was my least favorite of all the sides I have had. \n\nAll their salads are also pretty good.  The veggies in the salad are pretty much the same regardless of which salad you get: ice berg lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and onions.  Except for the Greek and pasta.  The Greek has feta and olives, and the pasta has a whole list of its own ingredients.  \n\nWhat differentiates the various salads are the additions and the dressing.  Beside the basic garden and Greek, the three other salads to choose from are: 1) the salmon or chicken caesar, 2) the chicken tikka salad, and 3) the sausage salad.  The salmon caesar is a great substitute for the Lovely Bit of Salmon pasty.  The salmon is cooked very well.  Juicy, not overcooked and not undercooked, seasoned just like the salmon in the Lovely Bit of Salmon.  Ask for a side of the white wine and dill dressing that usually accompanies the Lovely Bit of Salmon and you will not regret it.  That sauce is amazing.  This is my favorite salad. The chicken tikka is also good.  The chicken is marinated in a red rub or spice, like what you would find with tandoori chicken, and served on a salad with yogurt dressing.  Finally, the sausage salad was not my favorite.  They make the sausage in house, but I was a bit disappointed with the flavor and the way it was cooked.  It was overcooked, very dry, and a bit off.  I'm not sure if I would order it again.  I've had it twice and it was the same both times.\n\nOverall, this is one of the best restaurants in Tempe!",

I have not had another vegan pasty, decided that they do the others so good that I will indulge in the heavier tastier options instead! I pretty much always get the Lamb and Mint one but the last two times I got the Original which is similar to the lamb and mint (same sauce option) and less expensive (I can be kinda... thrifty I'll call it) We have have their cocktails a few times with no disappointment and they always have the Union Jack IPA which is one of my favorites! We always leave soo full and need a nap usually right when we get home but we always feel so satisfied.

An eclectic list of Pasty's both 'traditional,' 'signature,' and 'premium' plus a collection of soups, salads, and sides I asked Hannah about portions on her return and told that each pasty clocked in at approximately a pound (and that two would be \"way too much\" food for a solo diner since she could only eat half of one) thus leading me to settle on a single option, a dish I was told would take \"about fifteen minutes,\" leaving me more time to study and enjoy the tunes - the White Stripes perhaps the only thing 'un-British' in a string of songs ranging from Zeppelin to The Beatles to The Ramones.\n\nReading as I waited and enjoying the room as well as watching the team slice meat, shape dough, and chop vegetables it would be just under a quarter hour before my dish arrived and although smaller than I'd imagined (I definitely could have eaten two - probably three if I didn't have dessert and dinner plans) the Shepherd's Pie that was presented was far better than I'd have ever expected, a golden buttery shell wrapped around lightly mint tinged lamb and although fatty and intense nicely balanced by the vegetables.  Generally a fan of Shepherd's Pie, particularly when using a sharp cheddar, this handheld version would prove to be an exemplary take on the classic and the addition of a sidecar of onion and sage laden red wine gravy certainly did not hurt.\n\nDebating a second pasty as Hannah returned to check in on me (The Pilgrim sounds quite good) but subsequently turning my attention to the sweeter half of the menu I decided to not make the same mistake twice and inquiring as to which dessert she recommended I went with my gut and ordered two to arrive with a delay between them, the first \"Shirley Temple's Pudding,\" a $6 sticky toffee pudding served in a cast iron pot with a side of crème anglaise.  Rich and thick, a dark treacle just barely set at the center and almost a brownie consistency along the edges what really shined about this dish was the manner in which it worked with the crème, a thick but delicate sauce balancing out the intense sweetness of the pudding.\n\nMoving next to my second dessert, and for my tastes the better of the two, a goodly delay of fifteen minutes brought to the table Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding with vanilla ice cream - a truly unique spin on bread pudding made with what almost seemed to be cracker-thin pieces of bread juxtaposing a brandy tinged chocolate sauce and baked much like the sticky toffee pudding to be set at the edges yet dense and moist at the center.  Truly a decadent dessert - the sort begging for a glass of milk or coffee - I will say that the ice cream was rather run-of-the-mill vanilla and although it served its purpose admirably I'd definitely go with more anglaise on subsequent visits - visits which I'm sure will happen the next time I find myself drawn back to Tempe, or to Mesa where there is apparently a second location whose Banoffee Pie and Apple Caramel Pasties seem to be calling.",

Fantasies of red-bearded drunks dancing in shamrock fields with pots of gold had always accompanied the notorious rainbow in my childhood imagination. Then, I assumed the gays stole it. I was wrong. The Cornish own the rainbow. Let me explain:\n \nI became stranded in the Arizona desert when my Pinto got not one, but four flat tires. (Hit a hot speed bump and the tires melted right off.) I realized that I didn't have any food or water. At that moment, I knew I'd be fighting for my life.\n\nMy heart began to race. I was on the verge of having a panic attack. I had to settle myself down. I took a few deep breaths and knew what I needed--smooth jazz. I turned the radio to 95.5 KYOT (The Valley's original smooth jazz station). I couldn't believe my ears. Coolio's \"Gangsta's Paradise\" was blaring through my speakers. Projectile vomit shot out my mouth. Had my entire childhood been sold down the dry canal? I thought God was playing a sick trick on me. I shuffled through radio stations faster than old people shuffle board (i.e. I took my time). But, it was true. Thee \"Coyote\" sold out.\n\nAll hope had been lost. My spirit was shattered, and the little moisture I had left was now a soggy puddle in the passenger's seat. I was in a dire situation. In desperation, I checked between the seat cushions hoping to find some crumbs to eat but, instead, found a few petrified McDonald french fries. I looked at them and thought to myself: \"I'd rather eat pigeon crap.\" I flicked the fries out of my Pinto. I used my finger to write a goodbye message on the dirt-crusted windshield and began my trek across the arid valley. \n\nAs far as I could see, nothing but cacti and cheap Mexican food restaurants. The little vegetation was riddled with thorns and bore no fruit. The thought of a carne asada burrito tempted me like a mirage, but I knew the explosive diarrhea I'd get would dry me out quicker than a sponge in the sun. I had to stay strong and keep going. \n\nAfter four long minutes of walking, I gave up. The sun leached my energy and exhausted all remaining calories. The horizon held no signs of hope. Just signs for Filiberto's, Amado's, Los Favorito's, Armando's, Pedrito's, and Taco Bell. My pasty skin was turning pink and my balls looked like raisins, so I sat in the shade of a palo verde tree and prayed. I begged God not to let me die. I repented for my sins. I promised that if he let me live I'd never do anything bad ever again. \n\nThen, out of the blue, I felt drops of wetness on my bald scalp. I looked up to the sky and saw that a pigeon was dropping deuces from the branch above. (I guess He wasn't too fond of me flicking french fries onto the desert ground.) God trickled the sign I was begging for right on my forehead, and now He was putting me to the test. If I wanted to be saved, I'd have to eat pigeon deux. So, I bowed my head, placed my palms together, and said grace. \n\nThere was a trembling rumble that echoed across the desert, and it wasn't the sound of me regurgitating. As I stood up from the gravel to peer into the abyss of newly formed clouds, a surge of water swept my legs out from under me. Before I knew it, I was being carried away in a flash flood. \n\nMy next memory was waking to the sound of chirping birds. I flinched and covered my face fearing that I may be lying under another pigeon-riddled palo verde. I opened my eyes and was blinded by colors. I didn't know what was going on. Vibrant reds, yellows, and blues! I had no idea where I was. I got so scared, I pooped a Skittle. Then, it hit me. You know when people say that it's impossible to reach the end of the rainbow? It's a lie. It's at the entrance of a mystical place called Cornish Pasty. \n\nI entered the land of the Cornish and it was like no place I'd ever been. I expected leprechauns but encountered a species far more enchanting, with skins of the finest tapestries and earlobes so large and peculiar that they could double as tire swings. Apparently, I wasn't the first person to reach the End of the Rainbow, because this place was packed tighter than a carton of cigarettes. I tracked down one of these Cornish creatures and told her my story, explaining how famished I was. She was unusually polite and let me sit in her earlobe until a seat opened up at a table. I swung around the restaurant as she went from table to table, filling mugs up with magically frothy beer. Then, I whispered in her ear: \"Are there pots of gold here?\" A spot at a table had opened up, and she sat me down. She told me that she'd be right back. \n\nI sketched pictures of these Cornish creatures as I waited. The troll returned and placed a dish in front of me. She gave me a wink, then walked away. I grabbed the warm pocket of food that rested on the metal dish before me, stuffed it in my mouth, and died.\n\nIt was gold, my friends.",

The service is not as prompt and observant. We waited 10 minutes at our table before someone came to get our drink order. Once we got our drinks, we told her we needed just a few more minutes before ordering our food, but she didn't come back to take our order for almost another 15-20 minutes. Perhaps it was just out server, so I don't want to assume they are all like that. HOWEVER,  their pastys don't even compare to the other location first and foremost. Their vegan pastys are not as well made either and fall apart every time I have had them from this location. They were also out of mushy peas, didn't offer us more water or beer when we were all clearly out of drinks. Just little things that made it less of an experience than the other location. Like I said, I LOVE cornish pasty and will always continue to go and refer friends, etc. but do yourself the favor and drive the extra 10 minutes to the one on Guadalupe. It is BOMB.",

For the vegetarians, I highly recommend The Greek ($8.50) and the Balsalmic Portobello ($9) - both are flaky, delicious and oh so flavorful! My mates enjoy the more traditional meat and gravy pasties and rave about The Oggie (steak + potatoes) and The Royale with Cheese so there's something for everyone and you really can't go wrong!\n\nService\nVery attentive and friendly. Relaxed yet polite servers. The waiter kept a close eye on our beverages and offered refills on our water. I'm always concerned going with a large group to dinner about the check because rarely do I carry extra cash and some restaurants make a fuss about splitting checks. Thankfully, splitting checks isn't an issue at Cornish Pasty. Our server happily complied with our request without batting an eye. The service was excellent so we were fine leaving a little extra gratuity since it made splitting the bill easier. Our waiter was jubilant over the slightly more than 20% gratuity, which just underscores that this is not one of those fancy, pretentious restaurants that expects a generous tip. \n\nPhysical space\nBeware: The restaurant is NOT visible from street when driving down University. When I finally found the restaurant around the corner and walked up, the windows were black and it appeared as if it was closed. Fret not - it IS in fact open! Apparently the restaurant also recently expanded and friends who had visited the restaurant previously were impressed with the remodel. The bathroom was the one place that suggested more of a pub and college feel. On the bathroom walls I found strange graffiti art. Some inscriptions may have been written by Lady Gaga during her carnivorous costume days or a confused co-ed (e.g., \"I am meat\"). In any event, once you find the hidden restaurant delicious pasties and friendly service are just a few steps away!",

The pasties, chips, soup, broccoli bake - all of it is good. \n\nThe reason I'm only giving 4 stars is because of the service and seating setup. Most of my friends understand that eating here is kind of hellish and is usually to be avoided. The seating is very limited - if you're claustrophobic forget it. If you come with more than 1 (2 at the absolute most) people, forget it. There are two booth-table hybrids, way in the back, but be warned that your server will inform you that at any time, no matter how awkward, complete strangers are allowed to just plop down next to you at the same table and join your party. If you are a Larry David type individual with a need for personal space, you're gonna have a bad time. If it fits, they sits. \n\nAs far as the service goes, the soup de jour is \"I don't give a shit.\" \n\nOne time we asked for straws and our server just chucked them at us. I've asked \"do you have any seats available?\" and been told \"I don't know, go look.\" We've had employees actually ask us to move, along with all of our stuff, to a different table (yes, really) to accommodate another group. I've been given dirty looks for asking for a slice of lemon in my water. All kinds of heartwarming interactions.\n\nI haven't been to the other locations, but if you're a masochist that loves gourmet hot pockets this location is for you. Otherwise either get really drunk before you eat here, or just get it to-go.",

            "text": "Apparently hailing from the British city of Cornwall and here in Arizona finding its foothold at the appropriately named Cornish Pasty Company I had originally heard of the pasty during a recent trip to Philadelphia where the baked crescent was a daily special on the menu at The Dandelion but featuring the least the combination of beef, rutabaga, onion, and potato I cannot really say my interest as high - a situation remedied by the extensive (if inauthentic selection at Cornish Pasty Company and thus leading me through their doors just after 2:30pm where I'd find the small bar area still full but the larger dining room only perhaps half so.\n\nLargely unaware of the logistics of CPC - whether you seat yourself or wait to be seated and whether you order at the counter or at a table I stood and watched for a moment before deciding to seat myself and within moments a friendly young woman named Hannah greeted me, first offering a beverage - just water - and subsequently the restaurant's extensive menu which I browsed at length while listening to The Sex Pistols and then The Clash play overhead.  An eclectic list of Pasty's both 'traditional,' 'signature,' and 'premium' plus a collection of soups, salads, and sides I asked Hannah about portions on her return and told that each pasty clocked in at approximately a pound (and that two would be \"way too much\" food for a solo diner since she could only eat half of one) thus leading me to settle on a single option, a dish I was told would take \"about fifteen minutes,\" leaving me more time to study and enjoy the tunes - the White Stripes perhaps the only thing 'un-British' in a string of songs ranging from Zeppelin to The Beatles to The Ramones.\n\nReading as I waited and enjoying the room as well as watching the team slice meat, shape dough, and chop vegetables it would be just under a quarter hour before my dish arrived and although smaller than I'd imagined (I definitely could have eaten two - probably three if I didn't have dessert and dinner plans) the Shepherd's Pie that was presented was far better than I'd have ever expected, a golden buttery shell wrapped around lightly mint tinged lamb and although fatty and intense nicely balanced by the vegetables.  Generally a fan of Shepherd's Pie, particularly when using a sharp cheddar, this handheld version would prove to be an exemplary take on the classic and the addition of a sidecar of onion and sage laden red wine gravy certainly did not hurt.\n\nDebating a second pasty as Hannah returned to check in on me (The Pilgrim sounds quite good) but subsequently turning my attention to the sweeter half of the menu I decided to not make the same mistake twice and inquiring as to which dessert she recommended I went with my gut and ordered two to arrive with a delay between them, the first \"Shirley Temple's Pudding,\" a $6 sticky toffee pudding served in a cast iron pot with a side of crème anglaise.  Rich and thick, a dark treacle just barely set at the center and almost a brownie consistency along the edges what really shined about this dish was the manner in which it worked with the crème, a thick but delicate sauce balancing out the intense sweetness of the pudding.\n\nMoving next to my second dessert, and for my tastes the better of the two, a goodly delay of fifteen minutes brought to the table Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding with vanilla ice cream - a truly unique spin on bread pudding made with what almost seemed to be cracker-thin pieces of bread juxtaposing a brandy tinged chocolate sauce and baked much like the sticky toffee pudding to be set at the edges yet dense and moist at the center.  Truly a decadent dessert - the sort begging for a glass of milk or coffee - I will say that the ice cream was rather run-of-the-mill vanilla and although it served its purpose admirably I'd definitely go with more anglaise on subsequent visits - visits which I'm sure will happen the next time I find myself drawn back to Tempe, or to Mesa where there is apparently a second location whose Banoffee Pie and Apple Caramel Pasties seem to be calling.",

They also have a nice beer selection featuring many local brews. Started off with fresh chips and added melted cheese. They were fresh cut fries and really worth the calories!! \n\nWe ordered the cheese and onion and the Greek chicken pasty. The crust was so delicious, amaze balls really! The cheese and onion pasty was filled with potato, turnip, onion and cheese. Very tasty and satisfying (a tad salty though). Washed it down with Koffee Kolsch ale from Huss brewing company (local to Tempe AZ). This was a spectacular golden beer with a coffee and vanilla finish. \n\nThis is a great casual place with a unique food offering that I haven't seen stateside in all my travels. Small indoor bar with about 5 tables plus additional outdoor bar and seating.",

The idea of the Cornish Pasty lends itself to a diverse palate and the desserts, the beer selection, even the coffee here is very good. There are few cafes where you can go by yourself and feel comfortable sitting alone even when you are surrounded by couples on date night and rowdy college students and this is one of those places. There are many pasties to chose from and my favorite is The Cajun with my second choice being A Bit of Salmon. I have yet to try them all but The Mexican is next on the list. My favorite dessert is the Carmel Apple Pasty with Vanilla Ice Cream which is very good. I can be alone with my thoughts here or talk movies with the staff while they prepare, clean, and socialize with each other behind the long narrow bar. It is small and there is often a line but the solo diner can easily find a spot at the bar and I have never had a long wait.",

They have a fine beer selection (including Mickey's Big-Mouths) and a few cocktail options... Most of the sides and desserts are pretty solid.\n\nI tend to stick with and very much enjoy the more traditional pasties like The Oggie, and the Cottage Pie (OK, OK... I love the Royale with Cheese, too). However, some of the \"premium\" pasties like the Pesto Chicken and the Salmon pasty are a bit funky to me. \n\nEven that, I can write off to personal preference.\n\nWhat really keeps the CPC from getting another star or two is the restaurant itself. \n\nIt's a long, narrow space, 75% of which is divided by a bar. Seating is along the wall or at the bar, with a few larger tables in the back. \n\nOn the other side of the bar from the customers is where ALL of the restaurant operations take place; cooking, cleaning, prep, and bar. If one is sitting at the bar, this intersection of consumption with infrastructure is often a bit too much like watching sausage being made. \n\nI don't really expect a fine dining experience at a place like the Cornish Pasty, but I really don't need to hear the dishes crashing into the sink and i don't need to see all the potential for cross-contamination (food preparation right next to the dirty dishes and raw meat right next to the beer glasses). \n\nMy worst experience was arriving late and sitting at the bar while they were cleaning the \"kitchen\" area and still serving food. It was really noisy, the refrigerator light kept blinding me, and the smell of cleaning chemicals was so strong that it made it impossible for me to even think about enjoying the pasty. I walked out after about 4 bites...\n\nI've wanted to go back several times, because I do enjoy the food and beer options, and finally went back last Friday. The food was as good as it's ever been but the environment will still make me think 2 or 3 times before heading back.\n\nMaybe I'll just have to take advantage of their take-out and stop at Tops liquor on my way home for the Hoegaarden...",

Although a few things have changed over the years each one is usually an improvement and never a negative. \n\nIf you are not familiar, a pasty is a traditional British coal miners food.  A hearty filling wrapped in a pie crust and baked. Kind of a hand-held meat pie. Cornish Pasty Co. has taken this simple and traditional dish and meticulously perfected each component. Their crusts are some how simultaneously hearty and flaky. Although their is nothing delicate about their seasoning it is never out of balance and all of the ingredients are always quality. \n\nBeyond just mastering the finer details of pasty science, Cornish Pasty Co. has also branched off into wild and exotic flavors. It's no shocker that the British know Indian food and it shows with the tika masala and the lamb vindaloo pasties. What is shocking is the refinement of the Greek and Italian inspired pasties. Perhaps my favorite pasty, from the cuisine most elusive to the British, is the Carne Avadado. This is a Mexican inspired pasty that will satisfy even the most snobby Las Cruses/El Paso foodie. If you have ever talked Mexican food with one you will know just what I mean. \n\nI have eaten nearly every item on the menu and not a one disappoints. It took me ages to get past the pasties and start ordering soups and salads. Now that I have had the spinach, mushroom, walnut soup, it is difficult to save room for my old favorites. \n\nAlthough the mine shaft inspired interior is dark and cramped I have never felt uncomfortable there. The sound system is usually bumping classic rock and the employees are pierced and tattooed well beyond your typical wait staff, but everyone is friendly and service is typically good.\n\nIf I have to list a negative the only one I can think of is the food is consistently just a little better at the University location than the Dobson one.  No clue why, but everyone I've talk to seems to agree, the Tempe store has the edge on quality.  \n\nAfter you add a respectable selection of beers the only reason you won't be here every night is your waist line.\n\n\nEdit (4/30/2014):\n\nFood's still good... but...  \n\nThe service has gone down hill. What was once a staff of edgy, unique, and skilled individuals. They are now mostly pretentious hipsters, with a bad attitude and below standard skills at basic service.",

ALL of them.  There are only a few of the veggie pasties I haven't tried.  Outside of the original and traditional ones, though, the Rosemary Chicken and the Pilgrim have to be my favorites.  There's no need for side dishes or appetizer breads or anything, since every delicious bite you need comes wrapped up neatly in an egg-brushed pastry pocket fresh out of the oven.  It's exactly the right amount of food.\n\nThe owner is an extremely friendly, knowledgeable, and cool fella, and he's always looking at ways to make his business better.  He's chosen a great crew to meet the increasing demands of this growing hot spot, since everyone who works there is nice and down-to-earth.  I've never seen a single employee lounging or wasting time there.\n\nWhat they do really, really well:  (1) All of the FOOD, including the salads and desserts.  (2) The beer selection is incredible, full of tasty imports and domestics both on tap and in bottles.  (3) The prices are excellent.  (4) The decor is sleek and modern, complete with classic rock playing at a quiet yet audible volume.\n\nWhat they could improve on:  There's very little room for parties of 4.  There's plenty of counter space, a handful of tables for 2, and a custom table for 3 that's kind of neat, but the small area at the back that used to be smaller tables is now one large table.  Parties of 4 now take up the whole area (that could seat up to 8), making it awkward for any other big parties coming in.  Plus, you can't cut through tables to sit on the bench side of the booth anymore.  You have to scoot down the length of the table and then push everyone out again if you have to get up for any reason.  (A very small fault, considering that everything else about the place is incredible!)\n\nOverall, this is one of Tempe's best little restaurants.  Whenever I'm not craving food from a particular location, pasties have become the default food for my whole household.  They're always tasty and we just never get tired of them.  I have to move out of state soon, and of all the places we've eaten in our 10 years here, I will miss the Cornish Pasty Company the most!!!",

The Cornish Pasty Company is one of my favorite restaurants in Arizona. This is the place I take my family or other visitors when they come to see me in Tempe.\nThe pasties are absolutely one of a kind, with a taste you can't get anywhere else. I'd recommend the more traditional English types, by the way. Some of the weirder pastry flavors taste like merely their constituent parts: eg the lamb vindaloo just tastes like lamb vindaloo in a pastry. However the 'Oggie' or the pork with apples, they transcend their own ingredients like King Arthur riding a spectral dragon of flavor, reminding you of foggy London streets and rolling green hills of sheep!",

We thought the place would be larger, its a little small, but that's ok. It felt like we were in a British pub, and I've been dying to go to London. No, but seriously, the atmosphere is really cool and very original. Service as well as the staff here are very friendly and really cool.\n\nI don't drink, but the prospect of getting to choose from tons of locally brewed and imported beer is appealing. We ended up ordering a cheese steak pasty and a chicken tikka masala pasty. I was extremely skeptical and thought I was going to be in for a big disappointment. What business did this British pub even have THINKING about chicken tikka masala? To my surprise, I think I just tasted the BEST CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA IN PHOENIX. Hold up, Cornish Pasty Company, a BRITISH type PUB HAS THE BEST CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA in PHOENIX. I know, you must think I'm nuts, but I'm Indian and I thoroughly enjoyed this amazing interpretation of a stereotypical Indian dish. The tikka masala overshadowed the cheesesteak which I thought was rather bland. I think the issue here was that the chicken tikka was so overwhelmingly awesome. I can't wait to go back and have the tikka masala again and perhaps try something else.\n\nEverything here is super fresh, you can see them making the pasties and dough and everything. The pasties have a perfect texture and are golden brown on the outside. If you're unsure of what a pasty is, it is basically a chicken bake or calzone, but with different fillings. Really awesome.\n\nIt'd be awesome if the owner of this place decided to get a few TVs, then it'd be even more pub like. Also,  it'd be super duper awesome if he decided to pick up some English Premier League games on the weekends. I would most definitely come down for some breakfast pasties and watch a few games.",

Again, neither good nor bad, just a fact.\n\nMenu is amazing.  I love pasties and couldn't decide which to order.  There are also 4 soups and each one sounded better than the next.  The bread is homemade and to die for, served warm with a soft inside and crispy crust, as it should be.   There are 4 or 5 homemade potato dishes that I will attempt next time as well.  None of the frozen or instant variety here.  Can't wait to try the mushy peas.  Last time I had those were the real deal in London, but I am confident these will compare, if not exceed.\n\nService is fairly slow, but everything is being made as you order, so good quality, fresh food takes time.\n\nEverything and I mean everything is made from scratch.  Very impressive considering the narrow, tight small kitchen, which is open by the way for all to see.  I have no idea how they work in there, but they do and they do it well.\n\nPrices are great too. $6-$8 a pasty and should be enough for most appetites.   $2.95 a cup of soup with bread and butter.\n\nI will definitely be back until I taste every pasty on the menu.",

The place is usually dark & loud, which is definitely the atmosphere of this place (modeled to sorta feel like an old mine, without the coal dust). If you're looking for a brighter quieter place go to the library. Their pastys are freaking amazing. I think we've tried about 10 of them on the menu so far & our favorites are the Pilgrim & Roast dinner. The Pilgrim comes with a cranberry sauce that is super delicious with a red wine gravy style sauce that is also super delicious! The Roast Dinner comes with a creamy white sauce (still not sure what it is) and a red wine gravy sauce. We also like to get the sticky toffee pudding for dessert, if they have any available. If you like sweet super moist, rich, sorta carry desserts definitely try this. They some times serve it with ice cream, sometimes just cream, sometime both. The most recent time we were there we had both and it was so delicious (I think I like sticky toffee pudding with ice cream the best because it helps to cool it down & makes it even more sweet, but not sickly or overwhelmingly sweet). The only downside is the last two times we've come in they are out of hot tea. This time they were out of lemonade, but were able to 'find a tea bag in the back'. A British style restaurant out of tea? If this was London they would riot. This food is always delicious, atmosphere is unique, service can be a bit slow sometimes (that's because they're always busy in the evenings when we come), and bring a bag of tea just in case.",

They were crimped at one end so that the miners with the soiled hands could eat them and just throw out the end they were holding. Here the pasties range from $9-$11 each and the pictures on Yelp can be deceiving. You may think they look like a empanada but in real life they are the size of calzone, they are large. \n\nMushroom, Walnut, Spinach Soup - I'm a big cream of mushroom fan so I had to try this out. I ordered a full bowl but they only brought me out a cup of it. I asked if it was a mistake and they said they were out of the soup for the night so they gave me the smaller cup for free! After one sip I was wishing there was a bowl of it, because it was that good. Creamy mushroom without overdoing it on the cream, pureed spinach and walnuts with a walnut chunk in almost every bite. Served with warm sourdough bread. One of the best versions of mushroom soup that I have ever had.\n\nLamb & Mint Pasty (Lamb, Potatoes, Rutabaga, Onion, Fresh Mint) - My friends got this and I tried a bite. It was good, not gamey at all and paired well with the red wine gravy. Recommended. \n\nPeppered Steak Pasty (Sirloin Steak, Sautéed Portabella Mushrooms, Leeks, Roasted Zucchini, Stilton Cheese) - My server recommended this and it was all good until I forgot that it had Stilton in it. Stilton is a strong bleu cheese.  Don't get me wrong, this pasty was done very well... I would have liked it better if it didn't have Stilton in it but that was my bad for missing that on the description. If you enjoy steak and blue cheese, you will love this! Personal preference aside, this is a 5 star pasty.  It comes with a side of peppercorn brandy cream sauce which is delicious. This sauce is lightly sweet and creamy with pepper flavor but no heat and would be great with most of their pasties. If you can, ask for a side of this even if your pasty doesn't come with it. \n\nIf I make it back to Phoenix I'm going to have to try the Pilgrim (turkey, sweet potatoes and cranberry sauce), the Oogie (steak, potatoes, rutabaga), Shepard's Pie and Chicken Tikka Masala. The veggie offerings also look stupendous. \n\nThe only thing a Brit would find lacking is in their beer offerings. They do not carry too many brews from the UK. You can't get a Black and Tan or a Smithwicks here. Not a biggie, but just thought I'd mention it. \n\nUnexpected was the staff giving me the soup for free when I would have gladly paid for the smaller portion offering since I did order it. It was only a $4.50 difference, but Cornish Pasty Company went above and beyond to get it right, even when they didn't have to. \n\nNow if only they could figure out how to open other Cornish Pasty Companies across the nation (California please?)...",

The seating could be a bit more comfortable but the lighting and the hipster feel of the place is strangely calming. The menu is massive and surprisingly includes an entirely vegetarian section as well. I usually order the Mexican which comes with choice of vegetarian beef or regular. I decided to give vegetarian a try. I was certainly surprised. We ordered an appetizer of curried potatoes and baked beans and they were amazing. Finally we finished the meal with some beers and a desert of bread pudding. My one complaint is that they still don't have mushy peas. However, this is one of the few places that I insist on taking people new to the east valley.",

I love anything pie crust and these pasties definitely hit the spot.  The minced lamb from the Shepard's pie was  cooked perfectly and not too gamey. The Oggie was a classic and a comfort food. Oven chips were like french fries cooked with minced garlic and jalepenos that weren't spicy at all. I found out there's a location in Vegas and will definitely have to visit there to try the other pasties.",

If you say \"PASTE-EE\", that's something else completely. \n\nVEGAN REVIEW:\n\nWandering into Cornish Pasty from the bright AZ sun is a shock for the senses. I was momentarily blinded, because of how dark and dimly lit the restaurant was. After taking a minute for my eyes to adjust, I saw a couple empty tables and two waitstaff. I did not know this was a seat yourself kind of deal so my brother and I just stood at the doorway and waited for instruction. After about 5 minutes or so, a waitress told us to seat ourselves. \n\nWe came around 2pm, so many of the vegan pasties had been sold out and I was left with the choice between the vindaloo and the greek flavored ones. Upon the waitress' recommendation, I went with the vindaloo. My brother and I also ordered the Oven-baked Chips to share. \n\nThe Vindaloo Pasty was spicy and filling, but probably not something I would order again. The vindaloo filling did not offer much excitement in the flavor department, and eating THAT much vindaloo filling was kind of monotonous. I really wish I came earlier so I could have more vegan options to chose from but my mistake is your benefit! \n\nThe pastry part of the pasty was delicious! It was crunchy and had a wonderful pastry flavor that is hard to describe. If they sold a pasty full of the pastry, I would buy that in a heartbeat! When comparing  my pasty to my brother's, I could tell they didn't glaze mine, which is a comforting to see because they probably used an egg wash. \n\nThe oven-baked chips were 10/10.They were crunchy, crispy, and satisfying. You can't go wrong with fresh baked fries/chips!\n\nOverall, I would visit again (but earlier) to try more vegan pasties.",

A slight step up from a hole in the wall type of place, this quaint spot serves up good, tasty, and satisfying food hot from the kitchen.\n\nWhat is a pasty?\n\nA pasty's history can be associated with the tin miners in England.  The story goes that these miners were covered head to toe in dust and other nasty stuff and would eat these calzone like dishes as a means to have nourishment without the need to return to the surface.  Supposedly, the miners were able to eat the pastry like food by holding onto the \"handles\" and when done, discard the tainted remains into the mine thereby appeasing the spirits that haunted the mines.\n\nAt the Cornish Pasty Co. I can first hand recommend the Chicken Pesto.  Very good flavoring and filling.  Or you can go with the more traditional route with beef, potatoes, and swede.  The sauces that come with your pasty are there to accent the flavors and are highly recommend to try as well.\n\nPros\n* Good food\n* Originality\n* Portions\n* Customer service\n* Coat hooks at the bar\n\nCons\n* Small interior",

            "text": "I am reviewing the original Tempe location.  Given all the great reviews this place has gotten, I was wondering what I could add that hasn't already been said.  It's not only the only place in Tempe you can get a cornish pasty, but they are also freak'n awesome.  The Lovely Bit of Salmon was my favorite, but alas given my newly discovered gluten intolerance I am not able to part-take in such loveliness any more:  :(\n\nBut nevertheless, I still come here every now and then with my friends and husband.  They all chow down on the yummy pasties while I chow down on my salads, sides, and soups.  So, I decided to concentrate my review on those items. (Some of these dishes are not gluten free.  I had them before I found out about my gluten intolerance.) \n\nSoups:\nThey offer a variety of soups.  I have tried: 1) the cream of leek, potato, and stilton, 2) the cream of tomato and crouton, and 3) the red pepper, black bean, rice, chicken, and jalapeno.  They were all very good, but I was informed that only the red pepper one is gluten free.  I had the first two before I found out about my gluten intolerance.  Not only are their soups really tasty, full of flavor, they are all also accompanied by thick slices of fresh bread and butter, baked and churned in-house.  Absolutely delicious!  The are perfect accompaniments, and a bowl at $4.75 would make a tasty and light lunch that won't break the bank.  \n\nSides: \nThe garlic mashed potatoes and the garlic roasted potatoes are also very good.  Pretty much what you should expect.  Creamy mashed potatoes and nicely roasted red potatoes with a hint of garlic.  Not too garlicky.  \n\nThe mushy peas is one of my favorite side dishes that they serve.  I think I prefer them to the potatoes simply because they are something different that I can't get anywhere else.  And these ain't  no ordinary peas.  They are huge for peas.  Cooked really well.  Not too mushy (overcooked), even though they are \"mushy\" peas. There is a great texture and freshness to this dish.  The texture of these \"mushy peas\" is more like crunchy peanut butter than creamy peanut butter if we were speaking of peanut butter that is (it's an analogy. . . just go with it), and I think the freshness and the texture go hand in hand from not overcooking the peas.  \n\nThe broccoli and cauliflower cheese bake is also a nice dish.  It makes me think of mac'n cheese, but with cauliflower and broccoli instead of mac noodles.  I dont think this dish is gluten free.  It seems to be made with a cheese sauce that is thickened with a flour rue, then baked to give a nice golden, crusted top.  It was tasty as well, but could have used a bit more seasoning.  It was my least favorite of all the sides I have had. \n\nAll their salads are also pretty good.  The veggies in the salad are pretty much the same regardless of which salad you get: ice berg lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and onions.  Except for the Greek and pasta.  The Greek has feta and olives, and the pasta has a whole list of its own ingredients.  \n\nWhat differentiates the various salads are the additions and the dressing.  Beside the basic garden and Greek, the three other salads to choose from are: 1) the salmon or chicken caesar, 2) the chicken tikka salad, and 3) the sausage salad.  The salmon caesar is a great substitute for the Lovely Bit of Salmon pasty.  The salmon is cooked very well.  Juicy, not overcooked and not undercooked, seasoned just like the salmon in the Lovely Bit of Salmon.  Ask for a side of the white wine and dill dressing that usually accompanies the Lovely Bit of Salmon and you will not regret it.  That sauce is amazing.  This is my favorite salad. The chicken tikka is also good.  The chicken is marinated in a red rub or spice, like what you would find with tandoori chicken, and served on a salad with yogurt dressing.  Finally, the sausage salad was not my favorite.  They make the sausage in house, but I was a bit disappointed with the flavor and the way it was cooked.  It was overcooked, very dry, and a bit off.  I'm not sure if I would order it again.  I've had it twice and it was the same both times.\n\nOverall, this is one of the best restaurants in Tempe!",

Because what is a pasty if not a bread pocket stuffed with all the world's delights and 1,000 calories? Well, maybe not 1,000 calories, but it's close- it's also worth it! \n\nPrior to abandoning meat, my favorite was the royale with cheese (minus the shrooms please). My favorite food in the entire world used to be a round patty of ground beef, sandwiched between two sesame seed buns until I discovered this little treasure. A pocket stuffed with ground beef, cheese,  grilled onions (and get this) french fries!! It honestly doesn't get any better than this. That is of course, until I became a vegetarian.\n\nNow my favorite guilty pleasure has become the cheese and onion pasty. Packed with potatoes, rutabega, cheese and onions, and lots of ketchup on the size. Even though I know all the sodium will cause me to bloat up like a blimp later, I just can't resist eating it all in one sitting. There's a robust vegetarian menu, featuring Quorn brand mock-meat which has been delicious each time I've tried it. \n\nAnd every now and then, when you're determined to stay on the old diet wagon, but everyone in your lunch meeting wants pasties, fear not, they do have a salad menu!

It supports the  contents right to the last.   \n\nFillings I had the Lamb Vindaloo which was close, but, but missing a sharpness/ e.g  vinegar, that I usually look for but it was still really good.  Dipping sauce complements it nicely.  My wife had the banger's and mash  version with  a red wine sauce.  Again  pretty good. \n\nSo why  four stars?    Many comments here have mentioned a lack of sensitivity  with regards to the flavors/ herbs and the thyme was   way overused on the bangers/mash gravy and it's  a shame as you could taste what they were trying to get at. Additionally the price may seem like a little on the high side ( would be  daily)  but  think about what you have paid for every processed , gray meat  excuse, of a pasty  and just smile.    Worth  working your way through the menu.",

This is a dark restaurant, one that puts you in the kitchen. Literally. If you find yourself disturbed by seeing real kitchen professionals running around, then avoid this place. \n\nWalking in, I felt like I was going into a dive bar. All of the kitchen staff is motley, and I loved it. We took two seats at the bar, and were greeted by an awesome server. She got us Guinness (poured perfectly, that gets a star), and we got to check out the menu.\n\nVast, is a good phrase for this menu. If you haven't had a Pasty before, I like to think of it as a Hot Pocket that doesn't make you want to die.  I got the Cottage Pie Pasty, and my friend got the Italian Pasty. \n\nOur pasties were served on very distinct metal plates, with a sauce side. I had a red wine gravy, which was incredible. Tart and not thick at all. It was excellent. My friend had a marinara, he replied that it had a nice spice to it.\n\nThe food was excellent. My Pasty was filled with ground beef, potatoes, peas ,carrots, and cheese.  Warm, gooey, and it felt good being in there.\n\nThat is what I would say is the key to this place. You have to love it. You have to love feeling of the warmth every time the oven is opened, along with the following scent of roasted herbs and spices. The staff, rushing around, looking more like roadies than cooking professionals.\n\nThis place is real. It's alive. And it's good. Check out the menu, and go there. I will be going as much as possible.",

The cheese and onion pasty was filled with potato, turnip, onion and cheese. Very tasty and satisfying (a tad salty though). Washed it down with Koffee Kolsch ale from Huss brewing company (local to Tempe AZ). This was a spectacular golden beer with a coffee and vanilla finish. \n\nThis is a great casual place with a unique food offering that I haven't seen stateside in all my travels.

The Mexican has amazing flavor from hatch chilies, steak, potatoes, and egg with fresh salsa and sour cream.

The Pilgrim on the other hand is like that delicious meal you make the day after Thanksgiving with all the leftovers. It has turkey, stuffing, and sweet potatoes. It's delicious by itself but with the wine gravy and cranberry sauce it's become out of this world! It's like what a chicken pot pie wishes it could be and you'll be thinking about that wine gravy sauce at Thanksgiving wishing you had some. \n\nLastly, for dessert, and no meal at Cornish Pasty Co. can be complete without it, the chocolate bread pudding. Now you may be saying \"But Connor, I've had bread pudding and I don't like it.\" That's fine. It's literally like no other bread pudding. For starters I'm fairly certain the \"bread\" they use is cake. Secondly it's not cooked into a complete mush or gel. The layers of delicious sweet cake are clearly evident when you get it. About four layers on each one typed with creme anglaise and ice cream. Each bite is incredible.",

We thought the place would be larger, its a little small, but that's ok. It felt like we were in a British pub, and I've been dying to go to London. No, but seriously, the atmosphere is really cool and very original. Service as well as the staff here are very friendly and really cool.\n\nI don't drink, but the prospect of getting to choose from tons of locally brewed and imported beer is appealing. We ended up ordering a cheese steak pasty and a chicken tikka masala pasty. I was extremely skeptical and thought I was going to be in for a big disappointment. What business did this British pub even have THINKING about chicken tikka masala? To my surprise, I think I just tasted the BEST CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA IN PHOENIX. Hold up, Cornish Pasty Company, a BRITISH type PUB HAS THE BEST CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA in PHOENIX. I know, you must think I'm nuts, but I'm Indian and I thoroughly enjoyed this amazing interpretation of a stereotypical Indian dish. The tikka masala overshadowed the cheesesteak which I thought was rather bland. I think the issue here was that the chicken tikka was so overwhelmingly awesome. I can't wait to go back and have the tikka masala again and perhaps try something else.\n\nEverything here is super fresh, you can see them making the pasties and dough and everything. The pasties have a perfect texture and are golden brown on the outside. If you're unsure of what a pasty is, it is basically a chicken bake or calzone, but with different fillings. Really awesome.\n\nIt'd be awesome if the owner of this place decided to get a few TVs, then it'd be even more pub like. Also,  it'd be super duper awesome if he decided to pick up some English Premier League games on the weekends. I would most definitely come down for some breakfast pasties and watch a few games.",

The mood lighting really helps secure this. I was a little nervous at first since I didn't see any lights on outside but was instantly reassured after entering. \n\nThe staff here are quite friendly! Evident by the crowd they attract in addition to the recommendations they offer. \nOne funny observation was how the people sitting in the slightly elevated area all seemed to be on dates. How fitting. \n\nAmbience is small potatoes in comparison to the food though. The pasties here are BRIMMING with flavor. As the cross sections of the food show, there is no room for air pockets. Each pasty is absolutely stuffed with your selected filling. As a bonus, they look gorgeous. The cross sections are super colorful and the part where the pasty is folded and pressed looks like it's been woven like a basket. One other thing I like about this place is how you're given a small cup of sauce or gravy to dip your pasty in. While my chicken pot pie pasty was no where near being dry, I loved having this extra gravy at my disposal. (You can never have too much gravy) \n\nOverrall, I'm really excited about this place. I'll be sure to return with ample hunger. It can be very difficult to perfectly describe a flavor in its entirety so definitely try this place out for yourself.",

The pasty I had the first time was the Bangers and Mash, homemade sausage, some veggies including mash potatoes all inside a delicous pastry or pasty as it is apparently called across the pond. It came with an amazing red wine gravy that just put an already amazing concoction over the top. This place is cheap too! Less than 8 bucks for most the pasties and it is plenty to fill you up.

We decided to sit outside at the patio to enjoy the Fall weather. \n\nI got the Oggie and my friend got Shepard's pie with a side Oven Chips - added the garlic and jalepenos. I love anything pie crust and these pasties definitely hit the spot.  The minced lamb from the Shepard's pie was  cooked perfectly and not too gamey. The Oggie was a classic and a comfort food. Oven chips were like french fries cooked with minced garlic and jalepenos that weren't spicy at all. I found out there's a location in Vegas and will definitely have to visit there to try the other pasties.",

            "text": "So my friends from ASU had mentioned this Irish pub place that served what was called a \"Pasty\". From the sound of things, it was a hot pocket/pie sandwich type deal. They mentioned an array of options from pepperoni to peppered steak etc. All that being said, decided we should go there for dinner the night before I left Arizona. Especially after I saw 860 reviews with 4.5 stars up here on yelp. That's virtually unreal. Never had seen such ratings with as many reviews. Any who, drove up to what looked like a dead shopping strip with a bunch of stores/restaurants that looked closed due to the dark tint of the windows. When we opened the door though, it was actually pretty mind blowing. Walked around from what I guess was the front door to the bar side. Honestly, first thing I thought coming around that corner was that this place looked like something off the set of man vs food. Can't really explain it but if you're familiar with the show and happen to make a stop, you'll understand what I'm saying. So we sat at the bar and got our orders. I wanted something spicy so I looked out for something that I thought would match my liking on the menu. Found the Cajun chicken pasty which was spicy marinated chicken, ham, bacon, with chipotle sauce. My girlfriend ordered the bangers mash which was mashed potatoes, meatloaf and gravy. My Cajun chicken was amazing. Spiced to perfection as was hoping. My girlfriends bangers mash was ok. Not as much flavor as my Cajun chicken but still pretty good. All in all, I would highly recommend this place. It definitely lives up to the 860 reviews and 4.5 stars, a rare occurrence. Only mishap, which really isn't a mishap, is that if you decide you want to add any custom pieces together in your pasty, we were told you would have to make such request 24hrs in advance. These guys make the sandwiches hours in advance so that it's just put into the oven upon order. So if you're the type to want to customize your order, I suggest you call in advance but you likely won't make the a wrong decision with any of the available options.",

The vegetarian friendly menu consists of a lot of pasties and a few salads, all under $10 and very filling.  They even have dessert pasties.  I've been here many times, and the only dud I've ever had was a very dry Chicken Alfredo.  The Cajun Chicken has trumped the Balsamic Portabello as my favorite.  My main gripe with this place is that it is very small.  There are only 2 or 3 tables that seat more than 2, not counting the bar counter.  There is usually a wait for dinners on Friday and Saturday.  I'm just glad I live close enough to do take out on those nights since they don't deliver.

The mixture of chicken, cheese, beans, corn, and salsa inside had a nice and slightly spicy Mexican flare. The pasty was something like $6 and plenty for one person. The food is definitely the high point for this place.\n\nThe place was very busy when we arrived with about 8 people and we had to wait a long time to snatch a table (we were on \"the list\" but they don't appear to actually honor any such arrangements versus a free-for-all). There was also only one server running around the whole place, so it was difficult to place orders, get refills, remove leftover encrusted plates, etc. The drinks are priced relatively low and there were many types of beers on tap, which probably makes it a popular place for the college crowd. \n\nOverall, this might be a nice place to actually dine if it had better service and wasn't such a dive bar rather than an eatery. It would be nice if there were separate areas for a dinning room and bar. Right now, it seems like it really wants to be a bar, but it happens to randomly serve some good food.",

If you say \"PASTE-EE\", that's something else completely. \n\nVEGAN REVIEW:\n\nWandering into Cornish Pasty from the bright AZ sun is a shock for the senses. I was momentarily blinded, because of how dark and dimly lit the restaurant was. After taking a minute for my eyes to adjust, I saw a couple empty tables and two waitstaff. I did not know this was a seat yourself kind of deal so my brother and I just stood at the doorway and waited for instruction. After about 5 minutes or so, a waitress told us to seat ourselves. \n\nWe came around 2pm, so many of the vegan pasties had been sold out and I was left with the choice between the vindaloo and the greek flavored ones. Upon the waitress' recommendation, I went with the vindaloo. My brother and I also ordered the Oven-baked Chips to share. \n\nThe Vindaloo Pasty was spicy and filling, but probably not something I would order again. The vindaloo filling did not offer much excitement in the flavor department, and eating THAT much vindaloo filling was kind of monotonous. I really wish I came earlier so I could have more vegan options to chose from but my mistake is your benefit! \n\nThe pastry part of the pasty was delicious! It was crunchy and had a wonderful pastry flavor that is hard to describe. If they sold a pasty full of the pastry, I would buy that in a heartbeat! When comparing  my pasty to my brother's, I could tell they didn't glaze mine, which is a comforting to see because they probably used an egg wash. \n\nThe oven-baked chips were 10/10.They were crunchy, crispy, and satisfying. You can't go wrong with fresh baked fries/chips!\n\nOverall, I would visit again (but earlier) to try more vegan pasties.",

Fantasies of red-bearded drunks dancing in shamrock fields with pots of gold had always accompanied the notorious rainbow in my childhood imagination. Then, I assumed the gays stole it. I was wrong. The Cornish own the rainbow. Let me explain:\n \nI became stranded in the Arizona desert when my Pinto got not one, but four flat tires. (Hit a hot speed bump and the tires melted right off.) I realized that I didn't have any food or water. At that moment, I knew I'd be fighting for my life.\n\nMy heart began to race. I was on the verge of having a panic attack. I had to settle myself down. I took a few deep breaths and knew what I needed--smooth jazz. I turned the radio to 95.5 KYOT (The Valley's original smooth jazz station). I couldn't believe my ears. Coolio's \"Gangsta's Paradise\" was blaring through my speakers. Projectile vomit shot out my mouth. Had my entire childhood been sold down the dry canal? I thought God was playing a sick trick on me. I shuffled through radio stations faster than old people shuffle board (i.e. I took my time). But, it was true. Thee \"Coyote\" sold out.\n\nAll hope had been lost. My spirit was shattered, and the little moisture I had left was now a soggy puddle in the passenger's seat. I was in a dire situation. In desperation, I checked between the seat cushions hoping to find some crumbs to eat but, instead, found a few petrified McDonald french fries. I looked at them and thought to myself: \"I'd rather eat pigeon crap.\" I flicked the fries out of my Pinto. I used my finger to write a goodbye message on the dirt-crusted windshield and began my trek across the arid valley. \n\nAs far as I could see, nothing but cacti and cheap Mexican food restaurants. The little vegetation was riddled with thorns and bore no fruit. The thought of a carne asada burrito tempted me like a mirage, but I knew the explosive diarrhea I'd get would dry me out quicker than a sponge in the sun. I had to stay strong and keep going. \n\nAfter four long minutes of walking, I gave up. The sun leached my energy and exhausted all remaining calories. The horizon held no signs of hope. Just signs for Filiberto's, Amado's, Los Favorito's, Armando's, Pedrito's, and Taco Bell. My pasty skin was turning pink and my balls looked like raisins, so I sat in the shade of a palo verde tree and prayed. I begged God not to let me die. I repented for my sins. I promised that if he let me live I'd never do anything bad ever again. \n\nThen, out of the blue, I felt drops of wetness on my bald scalp. I looked up to the sky and saw that a pigeon was dropping deuces from the branch above. (I guess He wasn't too fond of me flicking french fries onto the desert ground.) God trickled the sign I was begging for right on my forehead, and now He was putting me to the test. If I wanted to be saved, I'd have to eat pigeon deux. So, I bowed my head, placed my palms together, and said grace. \n\nThere was a trembling rumble that echoed across the desert, and it wasn't the sound of me regurgitating. As I stood up from the gravel to peer into the abyss of newly formed clouds, a surge of water swept my legs out from under me. Before I knew it, I was being carried away in a flash flood. \n\nMy next memory was waking to the sound of chirping birds. I flinched and covered my face fearing that I may be lying under another pigeon-riddled palo verde. I opened my eyes and was blinded by colors. I didn't know what was going on. Vibrant reds, yellows, and blues! I had no idea where I was. I got so scared, I pooped a Skittle. Then, it hit me. You know when people say that it's impossible to reach the end of the rainbow? It's a lie. It's at the entrance of a mystical place called Cornish Pasty. \n\nI entered the land of the Cornish and it was like no place I'd ever been. I expected leprechauns but encountered a species far more enchanting, with skins of the finest tapestries and earlobes so large and peculiar that they could double as tire swings. Apparently, I wasn't the first person to reach the End of the Rainbow, because this place was packed tighter than a carton of cigarettes. I tracked down one of these Cornish creatures and told her my story, explaining how famished I was. She was unusually polite and let me sit in her earlobe until a seat opened up at a table. I swung around the restaurant as she went from table to table, filling mugs up with magically frothy beer. Then, I whispered in her ear: \"Are there pots of gold here?\" A spot at a table had opened up, and she sat me down. She told me that she'd be right back. \n\nI sketched pictures of these Cornish creatures as I waited. The troll returned and placed a dish in front of me. She gave me a wink, then walked away. I grabbed the warm pocket of food that rested on the metal dish before me, stuffed it in my mouth, and died.\n\nIt was gold, my friends.",

I love their mushy peas for a starter (although half of the time they are out) and then the Pilgrim to seal the deal. It's like a Thanksgiving party in your mouth any time of the year! All of their food is great, and this place is always busy it seems. Don't come on a Friday or Saturday night unless you like being in small spaces with a million loud drunks. Mid-afternoon is the best. The servers are usually pleasant, but some have a better-than-you hipster attitude. But hey, if you haven't been here yet, you're missing out on Tempe's best kept secret!",

And, oh yeah, us, the regular \"normal\" folks.\n\nWe got seated at a long bench, and the first thing we were told is that they were out of multiple items. Argh! that's always disappointing.  Two of us got soft drinks (soda + root beer), and they were FLAT. As in nary a bubble to be seen flat.  We told the waitress, and it was about 10 minutes later with some fresh bubbly sodas.\n\nDid I mention they were out of a ton of things? We eventually ended up with potato wedges (out of the fries), lamb pasty, thanksgiving pasty, leak + potato soup, and english toffee pudding. Why do establishments think it's cute to rename products which already have a perfectly acceptable name (I'm looking at you, starbucks)? \n\nBefore the food could come out, they seated a party of 7 LARGE individuals at our communal bench. We are a party of 4 normal to slender individuals, but the amount of human flesh pushed up to us was ridiculous.  There's personal space, and then there's hello, you are practically in my lap! Seriously, their party should have gotten a whole communal table to themselves because it was absurd.\n\nFood came - it was hot, and everyone seemed happy. I had the toffee pudding with vanilla ice cream. Really enjoyable, but it's hard to eat when your arms are squished by your side due to overflowing human flesh that's not yours, or your friend's. Sometimes I don't want to make new friends!\n\nNoise level: loud. Hipsters: present.",

Their british pub concept could be so cool, but instead it was really dark (blackout curtains on every window), way too loud (blaring music), and just overall way too hipster grunge for me (hello, Seattle). Dining experience aside, the menu is giant and the food is really good. I had:\n-  Greek Pasty: Vegetarian and I absolutely loved all the flavors in it. It was full of cheese, artichoke hearts, sun dried tomatoes, and olives all wrapped up in a warm buttery crust. \n- House Salad: Really fresh (amazing tomatoes) and good-sized. \n- Sticky Toffee Pudding: Having read about the dessert in English books, I've always wanted to try it. It was pretty good but probably not something I'd order again. After this dish and watching enough Downtown Abbey, I finally get that the English call their cakes \"pudding\". So it's not pudding at all, but a cake. There really wasn't enough of a toffee flavor, and instead most of the cake had a mild molasses flavor. Parts of the cake were really dry, so the vanilla ice cream its served with made it a lot better. This is certainly a fun dessert to try, but not totally my favorite.\n\nI only ate half of my pasty at dinner, then ate the other half a few hours later in the comfort of my own home, and definitely enjoyed the leftover half in my home a whole lot more. So overall, I really recommend the food, just in a to-go form :)",

Being that it's been a while, I decided to try it again with a friend who loves it. It is a loud, dark restaurant with the window shades down and minimal lighting, so we opted to sit outside since it was a nice day. Plenty of seating available and our server came out within a few minutes with some menus and our drink orders. I got the veggie chicken tikka masala pasty from their wonderful vegetarian section and my friend ordered the chicken Greek, her favorite. I was pleasantly surprised with my pasty, I loved the Indian spices and the flavors worked together well. The portion size was just enough that I was able to finish it and be full. They use Quorn for their veggie chicken and it's got a weird texture but mixed with other ingredients in a pasty, it works. \n\nLots to choose from here, veggie and meat lovers alike. There's locations in Mesa and Scottsdale as well, with one set to open in Downtown Phoenix sometime. Check them out! You're bound to find something you like.",

I have not had another vegan pasty, decided that they do the others so good that I will indulge in the heavier tastier options instead! I pretty much always get the Lamb and Mint one but the last two times I got the Original which is similar to the lamb and mint (same sauce option) and less expensive (I can be kinda... thrifty I'll call it) We have have their cocktails a few times with no disappointment and they always have the Union Jack IPA which is one of my favorites! We always leave soo full and need a nap usually right when we get home but we always feel so satisfied. It's turned into the spot my friends and I go to together and we have even done the take-home ones at some small get-togethers we've had! This and Welcome Diner have been my all time favorite spots here in Phoenix and everyone needs to experience it! Been wanting to take my parents here forever, was hoping to get to enjoy the DTPHX one but may just have to bite the bullet and take that long 12 minute drive to Tempe!

Their british pub concept could be so cool, but instead it was really dark (blackout curtains on every window), way too loud (blaring music), and just overall way too hipster grunge for me (hello, Seattle). Dining experience aside, the menu is giant and the food is really good. I had:\n-  Greek Pasty: Vegetarian and I absolutely loved all the flavors in it. It was full of cheese, artichoke hearts, sun dried tomatoes, and olives all wrapped up in a warm buttery crust. \n- House Salad: Really fresh (amazing tomatoes) and good-sized. \n- Sticky Toffee Pudding: Having read about the dessert in English books, I've always wanted to try it. It was pretty good but probably not something I'd order again. After this dish and watching enough Downtown Abbey, I finally get that the English call their cakes \"pudding\". So it's not pudding at all, but a cake. There really wasn't enough of a toffee flavor, and instead most of the cake had a mild molasses flavor. Parts of the cake were really dry, so the vanilla ice cream its served with made it a lot better. This is certainly a fun dessert to try, but not totally my favorite.\n\nI only ate half of my pasty at dinner, then ate the other half a few hours later in the comfort of my own home, and definitely enjoyed the leftover half in my home a whole lot more. So overall, I really recommend the food, just in a to-go form :)",

I admit, I was skeptical, I'm not a huge 'bread' or 'carb' fan, and I really don't like thick bread coated anything.  The pasties I've had in the past were similar to calzones in breadiness.  The pasties here, were something amazing and not at all what I've had in the past or imagined.  There menu was quite complete with heavier choices such as the meat and cheese to lighter chicken options and even some dessert pasties.  I opted for a chicken tikka masala pasty.  I was impressed by the presentation, a simple metal plate with the well portioned pasty cut in half and a side of tsaziki sauce.  The pasty crust was thin and delicate.  It was reminiscent of a hand worked Christmas pie dough that your Grandmother slaved over.  It wasn't too flaky or thick, and was the perfect match for the tasty filling.  The filling was delicious chunks of white meat chicken, little nibbles of potatoes and some peas in a deliciously balanced flavorful masala sauce.  The taste was quite authentic and the spice right on par with what I'd expect from an Indian food restaurant.  The tsaziki side sauce was cool and tangy, it was a good flavor contrast to the spicy meat pocket.  Since the  portion was rather large, I had more than half of my pasty left and took it to go.  I couldn't resist trying the PB&J pasty though.  I had one warmed and packaged to go.  I am SO glad I got the PB&J pasty as well.  It was so incredibly delicious!  Served with a side of fresh whipped cream, the PB&J was like an old childhood friend.  The warm crunchy peanut butter with the perfect banana slice and sweet strawberry jelly melted harmoniously in my mouth and still gave that satisfying 'coat your mouth' feeling that peanut butter does.  I will definitely return.",

Obviously not leaving without dessert and having already enjoyed the sticky toffee pudding and bread pudding on my prior visit this time we opted for the house-special Banoffee Pie and Caramel Apple Pasty, neither as good as the pair off puddings but both better than the vast majority of in-house pastries at restaurants in Phoenix and Scottsdale (where even top tier restaurants choose to outsource their desserts to Ms. Dempsey.)",

I'm a fan of tattoos and this style, even though I don't appear to be, so I was digging it. One side is a bar scene with pool and other games (briefly walked through); the other side was the restaurant. They have booths, tables and 'breakfast nooks'; host told us to sit wherever. \n\nService:\nA few different people approached us throughout our dining experience and all were nice. Two were very attentive, but one first forgot the lemon for our waters and didn't ask if I wanted more water each time she approached (so I asked since my cup was empty and sitting at the edge of the table - I thought this was the unspoken universal signal for 'please refill me' but perhaps she's new to serving lol). \n\nMenu:\nVery clear and not busy. I like that cuz some menus need to be revamped. So many choices, but I narrowed it down to four pastries quickly based on what I prefer. The Porky, Italian, All Day English Breakfast and the Lamb & Mint. I opted for the latter and overall was happy with my selection (one of my friends also went for this one and she liked it). \n\nFood:\nCame out warm and smelling delicious (of course I had to snap it first). I wanted to try it without the sauce and it was good, but not tasty. Adding the Red Wine Gravy made it very tasty so it makes sense there's not too much flavor before adding it (ate 1/2 with this gravy). My other friend was having one of the steak ones and his came with Peppercorn Brandy Cream Sauce so I asked for a side for my second half. Sooooo good! I did try a bite of the blue cheese steak pastry he had and very tasty to me, but you must love blue cheese if ordering that one FYI otherwise they said it's too overbearing (perfect for me and blue cheese lovers tho). \n\nRestroom: \nNot very pretty in there, but I wouldn't expect it to be in a hipster dive type bar. The stalls were not painted by an artist, lol, but the bright color choice was a good try. I hope all the graffiti was written when there wasn't a line since there's only two stalls. I'm thinking AZ doesn't have the law enforcing toilet seat covers. They had toilet paper, soap, working toilets (oh wait one out of the two was out of order), and running water...so that's really all that matters I suppose. The owner had a sweet long note pulled from Facebook on the wall (it was thanking the community/customers for their continued support) and I would have taken a pic, but left my phone back at the booth. \n\nOverall it was a good experience so I tipped well and didn't have leftovers.",

I'm always concerned going with a large group to dinner about the check because rarely do I carry extra cash and some restaurants make a fuss about splitting checks. Thankfully, splitting checks isn't an issue at Cornish Pasty. Our server happily complied with our request without batting an eye. The service was excellent so we were fine leaving a little extra gratuity since it made splitting the bill easier. Our waiter was jubilant over the slightly more than 20% gratuity, which just underscores that this is not one of those fancy, pretentious restaurants that expects a generous tip. \n\nPhysical space\nBeware: The restaurant is NOT visible from street when driving down University. When I finally found the restaurant around the corner and walked up, the windows were black and it appeared as if it was closed. Fret not - it IS in fact open! Apparently the restaurant also recently expanded and friends who had visited the restaurant previously were impressed with the remodel. The bathroom was the one place that suggested more of a pub and college feel. On the bathroom walls I found strange graffiti art.

She already has picked out her next two choices for return visits...\n\nA couple of things that really stood out to me: 1) You can get the Oggie (the basic pasty) partially cooked for a buck less than the menu price - then take it home and finish off the baking for that fresh out of the oven taste - very cool. 2) If you want desert, you have to order it first or share food, because there is no way to finish everything - sammie and side - and still want for more. 3) I've spent a lot of time in the mother land and don't remember the food every being this flavorful... but who really cares, this is good eats and did I mention the tapped hard cider??

Obviously not leaving without dessert and having already enjoyed the sticky toffee pudding and bread pudding on my prior visit this time we opted for the house-special Banoffee Pie and Caramel Apple Pasty, neither as good as the pair off puddings but both better than the vast majority of in-house pastries at restaurants in Phoenix and Scottsdale (where even top tier restaurants choose to outsource their desserts to Ms. Dempsey.)",

I'm a fan of tattoos and this style, even though I don't appear to be, so I was digging it. One side is a bar scene with pool and other games (briefly walked through); the other side was the restaurant. They have booths, tables and 'breakfast nooks'; host told us to sit wherever. \n\nService:\nA few different people approached us throughout our dining experience and all were nice. Two were very attentive, but one first forgot the lemon for our waters and didn't ask if I wanted more water each time she approached (so I asked since my cup was empty and sitting at the edge of the table - I thought this was the unspoken universal signal for 'please refill me' but perhaps she's new to serving lol). \n\nMenu:\nVery clear and not busy. I like that cuz some menus need to be revamped. So many choices, but I narrowed it down to four pastries quickly based on what I prefer. The Porky, Italian, All Day English Breakfast and the Lamb & Mint. I opted for the latter and overall was happy with my selection (one of my friends also went for this one and she liked it). \n\nFood:\nCame out warm and smelling delicious (of course I had to snap it first). I wanted to try it without the sauce and it was good, but not tasty. Adding the Red Wine Gravy made it very tasty so it makes sense there's not too much flavor before adding it (ate 1/2 with this gravy). My other friend was having one of the steak ones and his came with Peppercorn Brandy Cream Sauce so I asked for a side for my second half. Sooooo good! I did try a bite of the blue cheese steak pastry he had and very tasty to me, but you must love blue cheese if ordering that one FYI otherwise they said it's too overbearing (perfect for me and blue cheese lovers tho). \n\nRestroom: \nNot very pretty in there, but I wouldn't expect it to be in a hipster dive type bar. The stalls were not painted by an artist, lol, but the bright color choice was a good try. I hope all the graffiti was written when there wasn't a line since there's only two stalls. I'm thinking AZ doesn't have the law enforcing toilet seat covers. They had toilet paper, soap, working toilets (oh wait one out of the two was out of order), and running water...so that's really all that matters I suppose. The owner had a sweet long note pulled from Facebook on the wall (it was thanking the community/customers for their continued support) and I would have taken a pic, but left my phone back at the booth. \n\nOverall it was a good experience so I tipped well and didn't have leftovers.",

I'm craving it!\n\nI ended up splitting with Nathan S. and also got to try his Chicken Tikka Masala (see pics) which tasted very much like real authentic CTM.....although I did feel it was a bit spicy for my taste I liked it and the yogurt sauce helped cut the spice. \n\nSo that being said I ordered 2 Pasty's to go to bake at home and let me tell you that is the ticket! The hotter they are the better they taste!! \nThe Fam agreed they were a hit and once again Super Mom saves the day! \n\nP.S. \nStrangely enough there was no mention of our dessert???? NATHAN?

It's kind of a weird set up. The suite is a very narrow rectangle that spans from end-to-end of the building so the space is limited but they made the best of it. You can tell the crew is a unique one and you can see they all understand each other and their duties as they would have to, being that they are constantly on top and all over each other (NOT LIKE THAT! GET YOUR MIND OUTTA THE GUTTER!). It's actually quite entertaining though! They also have great music playing most of the time and serve beer! You really have to go and check it out for yourself; there's no place like it. My goal is to one day try all the different pasty's. \n\n***Da Bafroom: Mr. Pasty, may I call you Cornish?

I've never had a pasty before so I didn't know what to expect but judging from the pictures I had a general idea of what it would taste it. We came in fairly late around 10pm and since I was going to run the Arizona 1/2 marathon the following morning I opted for one of the lighter dishes. They truly have a wide variety of what would go in your pasty from burger, to Alfredo to even Indian chicken tikka masala. I ordered the salmon one, which I did enjoy. The crust went perfectly with the well cooked salmon. There was also spinach with dill sauce and other things that I can't remember. If I was feeling adventurous and didn't have to worry about eating light I would of ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala since our server said that was one of her favorites. Although we had no room for dessert we ordered a banoffee pie to go. This was really tasty as well great combination of bananas, gram cracker, whipped cream and caramel. From that Yelp picture the caption says it's Banana Cream pie, don't make the mistake of asking for it because our server corrected us and told us it was Banofee pie, haha! The inside of this place is a hybrid between a dive and a pub because it was dark and had community style tables. Our server was pretty good I guess but nothing memorable in terms of outstanding customer service. I can see why this is a popular spot among ASU students. Most if not all the pasty selections are less than $10. Even half a pasty is filling so you could even share one. Pasty places aren't too popular so I would definitely recommend trying them out. I don't know when I'll be in Phoenix again, but if I'm in the Tempe area I will definitely stop by.",

I like that the cooks have a tip box too, that way I can hook it up if the food or cooks go above and beyond which is most every time. I'm scared to go to the other Cornish pasty because I'm afraid it won't compare... It looks a little too clean and contemporary and in my experience the original is always the best.

Any foodie knows there is more to a restaurant experience than a great product. An amazing restaurant has three basics covered:1) customer service 2) great food offerings 3) an overall great experience. This place lacks customer service which kills the experience. I stood there on a packed Tuesday and saw 3-5 different employees walk by with no acknowledgement that I existed. No eye contact, no greeting, no words at all! After 10 mins and a line out the door I left irritated and ticked. \n\nI sympathize with the youth movement and the college atmosphere this place has, however customer service needs to be emphasized to the men and women working the floor. They are the face of your store and if this trend continues, eventually customers will get fed up and go elsewhere. If I am an owner I would be pissed if this negative behavior was going on in my business. The business acumen is very important and should be a learning tool to teach the college kids the important lessons which can be applied to all different job titles. The staff I saw working tonight looked lazy and tired. Maybe due to the high temperature of the restaurant however with poor customer service and lack of a face in the entrance greeting me with a smile and a friendly greeting, it leaves me feeling like you don't want my money and you don't care enough about your customers standing around. Eventually the attitude of we have a superior product that ppl pay for and they not have to worry about customer service will come back to bite them in the butt.\n\n\nAreas for improvement\n\nThe waiters should be focused on turning tables and getting the checks as soon as the dessert is finished as opposed to walking around with their heads cut off. More tables being turned equates to more tips. I saw 4-6 tables sitting talking on their phone when they could have been served their checks or ordered more food. My avg time from start to finish was between 90-120 mins! You cut my time in the restaurant to 60 mins with efficient service and food running from the kitchen this place could double its profits and increase tips. \n\nThey need someone to work the front and greet the customers and let them know they are wanted, appreciated and they want to provide me with a great meal! \n\nDrinks out in under 5 mins from order (I waited 20 mins and she forgot about my 2nd beer later in the evening and I had to remind her so 30 mins for a pint of beer...total wait time for 2 drinks: 50 mins\n\nNotification on food times (depends on who is working) \n\nChallenge your servers to turn tables faster \n\nServers need to be smiling and social",

They were more interested in chatting with other servers than waiting on our table.\n\nI've given the three stars only because the food is the same tasty dishes that are served in Mesa, but as far as I am concerned, this place needs a visit from the owner and from the health department.",

It gives a strange sensation at night...maybe it's just me.  But this place was pretty dark outside.  \nGreeted immediately upon entering...always a great first impression.  The interior was dark but decently lit.  Seating was primarily either the bar or long communal tables w/ benches.\nThey play some cool metal/alt music that must be local or unsigned cause shazam wouldn't even pick that up.\nI went straight for the \"Premium\" section and got a Tandoori Chicken Pasty.  So the pasty itself is cut in half but it's a little difficult to eat like a hot pocket since it does fall apart, so you're better off with utensils.  But I'm a savage so I eat with my hands...take that pasty.\nDon't forget the fries!  Garlic!  With Jalapenos!  Fresh cut, some skin, and nice and crispy!",

At first I tried to ignore it, but eventually curiosity got the best of me. So many rave reviews about this  'glorified hot pocket'. I'm thinking, yes I like hot pockets, but I don't know if I could take that affinity to the restaurant level. \n\nCornish Pasty Company happened to be literally less than a mile from our hotel so we had to check it out. We got there right before the dinner rush and barely waited for a seat at the bar. I decided on the chicken tikka masala and the bf got the peppered steak. He was intrigued by the bleu cheese. We were both happy with our orders. There is a decent wait from the time you order, but just think of every minute going towards a perfectly baked pasty. Now I understand how people can compare it to a hot pocket. This is the epitome of hot pockets and I can't find the words to a description that justifies how good it is. \n\nOur waitress and the kitchen guy we chatted up were both suuuper nice. The waitress was very attentive and quick. The place itself is pretty dark (literally, dim lighting) and has that euro dive bar feel to it. I enjoyed sitting at the bar, feeling like a local and watching the kitchen staff work those ovens. \n\nThe food alone would have gotten me to love them. To top it off, they have THREE DOLLAR irish car bombs!!! Their receipt even says \"IRISH CAR BOMB... F... YEAH\" haha, they definitely know what's up. \n\nNo doubt I'll be back for more the next time I'm in the area.",

So I felt compelled to write a review about my experiences so that others would know this Cornish Pasty is in need of some management/owner love/help or something.... \n\nService~ yikes! It was turrible, to quote Charles Barkley.  Both visits were the same experience but with different servers.  The servers here seem more interested in talking with each other rather than serving their customers.  On both visits we had to remind our server multiple times to refill our drinks and bring us condiments.  Probably the biggest disappointment is when we complained about our food.  They both were very disinterested in turning our poor dining experience into a positive one.  When we asked to speak to someone in charge in our 2nd turrible visit the waitress disappeared!  I kid you not!  She never came back and when we asked the bartender about her she stated that she went on a break....\n\nFood~ prior visits we've had a pretty good experience trying the different pasty's however lately their food has not been up to par!  The pasty's are very dry lately for some reason and they lack flavor.  This last visit we had the bangers and mash, chicken and the traditional beef and potatoes.  We also had a couple of side of fries and some salads.  The salads and fries were the best parts of our dining experience again unfortunately.  The banger and mash was ok.  It had a good balance of bangers to mash but had too much onions.  Since when did onions become a major star in this pasty?  The chicken pasty was not filled completely and was very dry.  The waitress suggested the red wine sauce to help?? WTH?  NO THE RED WINE SAUCE DOES NOT GO WELL WITH ALL PASTY'S, ESPECIALLY THEIR CHICKEN PASTY! It was gross!  We asked for a different sauce.   The waitress stated that was their only sauce but she could bring us ketchup and that's what a lot of people use.  Yes she did say that! If a lot of people are requesting ketchup, the cook, heck the owner needs to know their customers are having to douse their pasty's in ketchup because they are too dry.  The beef and potato pasty was more potato than beef and yes it was arid dry as the desert....\n\nSo for both visits I give this Cornish Pasty 2 stars because of their salad and fries.  For had we not order those this would easily be a 1 star review. I hope they can turn this place around soon!",

One is a meal.  Here they precook them until they are almost done, then finish them when you order.  This process introduces a drying effect that detracts from the product.  They do serve a sauce with each pasty, and as the sauces we tried were quite good, you can use the sauce to counteract the dryness. When all is said and done, the pastys are tasty.  But not knock-your-socks-off great.\n\nThe atmosphere at Cornish Pasty Company is cramped and noisy.  It seems more like a college hangout than a restaurant, and this is not surprising because it is a college hangout, but one where the quality of the food has attracted a wider clientele.  If you like this kind of atmosphere, you will be right at home at one of the few small tables or at the bar.  I prefer the bar.\n\nPrices are low (typically about $9 for a pasty), considering the size of the meal.\n\nHints:\n1.  It is always crowded.  Try to come at an off hour, like 4:30 on a weekday.\n2.  Skip the very average salads and the oven chips (dry, tasteless), and probably the other appetisers.  Just get a pasty.  If you are an abnormally big eater, follow it up with a dessert pasty.\n3.  It is a bit hard to find.  Turn North on Hardy from University to find the Cornish Pasty Company in a small shopping center hidden by a large gas station.",

And look, I'm not advocating you slap a constantly illuminating \"Open\" sign on the front of this restaurant, but its position on the side of a strip mall made it hard to find!\n \nCornish Pasty had a ton of vegetarian options. Most of them had Quorn fake meat. If you've ever looked hard enough, you'll find Quorn at your local Kroger, or definitely at a Whole Foods. Just substituting meat with Quorn works quite well.  If you're up for eating a $10 Hot-Pocket-on-steroids, go to Cornish Pasty Company.\n \nThe veggie BBQ Spicy Chicken pasty was fun to eat. The homemade BBQ sauce was tangy, and the jalapeno and red onion stood out. I also ended up ordering a cheese plate and bowl of broccoli soup. I ate the soup too quickly and burned my tongue. What a disaster. The cheese plate was fine. The flavors were strong - sharp and or stinky was the name of the game. The plate came with pieces of toast, which was a lot of bread. But hey, in this pub-like environment, bread can be a good thing.\n \nIf I end my health kick, I'll definitely swing back by and try a different pasty.",

            "text": "Started patronizing this Cornish Pasty location when they were just a hallway and a kitchen.   The place was awesome, with food you couldn't get anywhere else in town, and a great selection of craft beers.  It was fun to sit at the counter and watch them make the pastys.   I wish that I'd reviewed the place previously, as I would have given them 4 stars over probably a dozen previous visits but I wasn't really a Yelper then.    \n\nNow the place has expanded significantly, and it appears business volume has kept up with this expansion, which means they are almost certainly profitable.   And that's what makes my last visit so hard to understand.  \n\nFirst, our table in the back corner of the dining room -- the glass surface was broken from what was likely a few too many full plates and empty pints being forcefully put down on it, and it appeared as if many a beer had been spilled on that section of the table because the metal latticework under the cracked section of glass was a mysterious dull brown moldy/mildwey color for a good 2\"-3\" to each side of the glass.  But the lights were dim and it didn't smell so we decided to ignore it.  \n\nSecond, the men's room -- I stepped in here after we ordered but before our food was delivered.  This was one of the most disgusting restaurant men's rooms I've ever been in.  There was a lot of urine on the floor, broken tilework and molding everywhere. There were several paper towel dispensers, all of which were empty and appeared broken anyway, so I was forced to go find toilet paper to dry with after washing my hands.   All of the toilet paper rolls were sitting out on the back of the toilet or on top of what at one point had been a functioning tp dispenser.   To acquire some toilet paper meant picking the roll up off of a surface that looked like it hadn't been cleaned in days or maybe weeks.  I wish I hadn't glanced at the toilet.  There are dive bars that don't even serve food with bathrooms that are 100x as clean as this one was. \n\nThird, our food -- When I came out of the horribly filthy men's room, I should have immediately cancelled the food order and taken my family somewhere else for dinner.    That men's room was a sign.    My beer was not hot, but not cold, just cool.  It should have been a lot colder.  The three of us all ordered different pastys, mine was the Royale with Cheese, and we all felt sick late that night and into the next day.  If just one of us had felt sick, chalk it up to something else, but Cornish Pasty was the common denominator.  \n\nFinally, our service -- Our server was actually great.   She was prompt, checked up on us frequently, and got our orders exactly right.  She did a fine job, and the other stuff we experienced was not her fault.  I tipped her out well.  What I noticed though, was that while the place was slammed, other employees were, at times, inexplicably wandering around the restaurant with their phones held out in front of them, distracted, not paying attention to what was going on around them.   Not sorry to be an ass here - you're at work.   Snapchat your friends and Pokemon Go ANY OTHER TIME except for right now.    \n\nI don't care how slammed you are, how unique your food is, how close you are to the largest university in the nation or how many times I've been there in the past and been happy.  You can't manage a restaurant this way, there's absolutely no excuse for it.   If this place were to have received a health code inspection the night I took my wife and 17 yr old daughter there for dinner, I have no doubt they would have failed.   This is management's responsibility and ownership should hold them accountable.",

Hardy Dr. \n\nUpon entering, my eyes had to adjust to the extremely dark lighting and interior. There are several entrances to the place so you might have to walk around a bit to get to the main dining area. We walked through the bar area (which smelled like a college pub) to arrive at the main dining area which was fairly empty. There was only one other table occupied besides ours and a couple patrons at the bar. After, we were at a loss of what to do as no one directed us towards a table or told us to seat ourselves. Finally, we asked the chef and he said you can grab any table you want. My friend went up to get menus herself and we perused for several minutes before our waitress arrived. She was helpful in taking our order but she certainly took her time in attending to us and serving our food. Which was confusing to me as there was only one other table she had to attend to. \n\nWhen I asked her what the red wine gravy was made of, she was confused by my question and did not answer correctly. She did state that the alcohol evaporates however I could clearly taste it when I ate it with my pasty. \n\nThis place's only saving grace was its food. I ordered the Oggie pasty which was wonderful except the meat tasted slightly undercooked. My friends all loved their pasties and the flavors came together beautifully. \n\nThey did split the check between four credit cards.\n\nOverall, I would not come back, nor would I recommend this place to others.

            "text": "First things first: Don't pronounce \"pasty\" to rhyme with those things strippers use to cover their nipples (um, or so I've heard...). It's pronounced \"pass-tee.\" \n\nPasties are a traditional lunch food for miners from Cornwall in the UK. They go back hundreds of years, and you can read the menu to learn all about that. Dean, the founder, head chef and all-around professor of pasties, will be happy to add even more, being the good Cornish lad he is. \n\nNow, there are a bunch of things I like about CoPaCo. First, the pasties range from the traditional to the totally off-the-wall. The recipes are so varied, from the Royal with Cheese to the Lamb Vindaloo and the Lovely Bit of Salmon, that I can't even pick a favorite. If I go there 10 different times, I'll eat ten different pasties. They're hand-made each day, including the dough. The kitchen crew at this place proves humans built the pyramids - these guys work their tales off keeping the pasties coming, and they make Amish barn raisers look lazy.\n\nSecond, it's just a fun place. There's usually good, hard rock 'n' roll playing over the sound system. It's a place where you can have some ribald antics and loud laughter and nobody cares. It's laid-back and unpretentious. The staff is courteous, though they can get a bit harried during the busy hours. But they'll always try their hardest and be friendly.\n\nThird, there are some great desserts. The bonofee pie (graham cracker crust, whipped cream, bananas, caramel!) is my favorite.\n\nWhat could be better? Eh, I'd ditch the taps that disgorge Kronenburg 1664 and Hoegaarden and drop in a fewer higher-octane brews. In the meantime, the cooler is full of bottled selections. The Skull Splitter is awesome!\n\nKeep in mind that even though I gave it five stars, this is not a fancy, high-falutin' sort of place. It's absolutely perfect for what it is: a fun place to gather with your hooligan sidekicks, eat creative twists on the Cornish pasty and listen to some rock music. Brilliant!",

If you don't know what it is, think of it as like a larger, tastier & fresher hot pocket. I normally stick with \"The Oggie\", \"Bangers & Mash\" or \"Cottage Pie\". All 3 are excellent. I also request an extra side of their red wine gravy. Its amazing!\n\nDon't be scared off when you walk in to find dark walls, dim light and rock music playing. Nor the servers & chef's with tattoos and piercings... because you could easily miss out on one hell of a meal.\n\n(I'd like to add that if you want to avoid the small, dark space with limited seating, you can always try out their other location off Dobson & Guadalupe).",

The staff was friendly and order taking was prompt.  Although it did take longer than anticipated to actually get food, but I imagine that's because they don't have things pre-made.  The food was quite flavorful and the proportions were adequate.  The stuffing was moist and the outside crust was just the right amount of crispiness.

But thinking about it, its like $2 more than you would pay for something else at like say Chipotle. So its totally worth the extra $2 to get something you cant get anywhere else, that tastes 10 times better than anywhere else.\n\nThe beer menu is nice to, and with the expanded patio, I will go there again for happy hour, or a late night on the patio for a Lagunitas.",

These puff pastry stuffed bundles of heaven erupt with surgically precise flavor combinations that leave me speechless every single time. \n\nMy new favorite is the Lamb & Mint, a delicious combination of succulent and juicy lamb, perfectly sliced potatoes, rutabaga, and of course, the fresh mint sprigs make for a truly transcendental dining experience. \n\nAfter tasting more than 3/4 of their menu, I have yet to taste a single thing that wasn't perfectly cooked, perfectly spiced, or perfectly paired with their exquisite red wine gravy. I could drink that delicious concoction by the gallon. \n\nThe vegetarian pasties are undeniably good as well, the Eggplant Parmesan is a worldly experience that I could eat any time, any day. It stuffs the best bits of the garden into a mozzarella, marinara and Parmesan wrapped envelope of goodness that has to be tasted to be appreciated.\n\nThe Cream of Leek, Potato and Stilton Cheese soup is out of this world, the Garlic & Herb Roasted Red Mashed Potatoes with Cheese make all other mashed potato dishes taste like dehydrated flake garbage, and the desserts (if you can find any more room in your belly for awesome) are the food of gods. The PB&J Pasty or the Banoffee Pie make me want to live in this restaurant until the day I die.\n\nThe location is being renovated currently to expand into the adjacent building, which is a welcomed change as the intimate dining area admittedly cramped on busy days. Though it is a wondrous experience to watch the staff prepare their pasties mere feet from your seat, it will really do well to have a few more tables. Sit at the bar if at all possible for the best dining experience.\n\nI wish I could give CPC 6 stars simply because the other places I've deemed worthy of 5 stars simply cannot compare. On top of all this, the unparalleled drinking specials, 32 oz steins, and $3 car bombs every day make this not only a wonderful place to eat, but a perfect spot to pickle the liver as well.",

Obviously not leaving without dessert and having already enjoyed the sticky toffee pudding and bread pudding on my prior visit this time we opted for the house-special Banoffee Pie and Caramel Apple Pasty, neither as good as the pair off puddings but both better than the vast majority of in-house pastries at restaurants in Phoenix and Scottsdale (where even top tier restaurants choose to outsource their desserts to Ms. Dempsey.)",

            "text": "A modern take on a British staple, Cornish Pasty Company has about 50 different pasties to choose from including at least 10 vegetarian pasties and even some dessert pasties too! \n\nThe restaurant has a Brit pub feel to it, with a bar bar on one side and a dining area and counter seating on the other. \n\nCornish Pasties were a working class food for miners. They were crimped at one end so that the miners with the soiled hands could eat them and just throw out the end they were holding. Here the pasties range from $9-$11 each and the pictures on Yelp can be deceiving. You may think they look like a empanada but in real life they are the size of calzone, they are large. \n\nMushroom, Walnut, Spinach Soup - I'm a big cream of mushroom fan so I had to try this out. I ordered a full bowl but they only brought me out a cup of it. I asked if it was a mistake and they said they were out of the soup for the night so they gave me the smaller cup for free! After one sip I was wishing there was a bowl of it, because it was that good. Creamy mushroom without overdoing it on the cream, pureed spinach and walnuts with a walnut chunk in almost every bite. Served with warm sourdough bread. One of the best versions of mushroom soup that I have ever had.\n\nLamb & Mint Pasty (Lamb, Potatoes, Rutabaga, Onion, Fresh Mint) - My friends got this and I tried a bite. It was good, not gamey at all and paired well with the red wine gravy. Recommended. \n\nPeppered Steak Pasty (Sirloin Steak, Sautéed Portabella Mushrooms, Leeks, Roasted Zucchini, Stilton Cheese) - My server recommended this and it was all good until I forgot that it had Stilton in it. Stilton is a strong bleu cheese.  Don't get me wrong, this pasty was done very well... I would have liked it better if it didn't have Stilton in it but that was my bad for missing that on the description. If you enjoy steak and blue cheese, you will love this! Personal preference aside, this is a 5 star pasty.  It comes with a side of peppercorn brandy cream sauce which is delicious. This sauce is lightly sweet and creamy with pepper flavor but no heat and would be great with most of their pasties. If you can, ask for a side of this even if your pasty doesn't come with it. \n\nIf I make it back to Phoenix I'm going to have to try the Pilgrim (turkey, sweet potatoes and cranberry sauce), the Oogie (steak, potatoes, rutabaga), Shepard's Pie and Chicken Tikka Masala. The veggie offerings also look stupendous. \n\nThe only thing a Brit would find lacking is in their beer offerings. They do not carry too many brews from the UK. You can't get a Black and Tan or a Smithwicks here. Not a biggie, but just thought I'd mention it. \n\nUnexpected was the staff giving me the soup for free when I would have gladly paid for the smaller portion offering since I did order it. It was only a $4.50 difference, but Cornish Pasty Company went above and beyond to get it right, even when they didn't have to. \n\nNow if only they could figure out how to open other Cornish Pasty Companies across the nation (California please?)...",

When they were still serving your pasty in a basket, cheap tables and chairs, no liquor license, you always saw the owner there working and the menu was so short. \n\nOh, how its grown, and I love it even more now. The new expansion is awesome! The beer they have on tap is fantastic, the staff is always welcoming and friendly! They've done such a great job. I recommend this place to everyone and I try to visit at least every couple months or so. Every time someone visits from out of town, I make sure to bring them there. If someone has never heard of it before, I tell them all about it. Many people have been pleased by going after I tell them about it! I've never heard any complaints. I only have 1 of my own, and its never stopped me from returning. I had one bad pasty, too much garlic. I can't say how many times I've visited, but its always been a very enjoyable experience. I will keep returning, keep talking them up and still bring in new visitors with me!! \n\nI love the Royale with Cheese, Cajun Chicken, Chicken Alfredo is my favorite, Pesto Chicken and Rosemary Chicken. I always want to try new ones, but I love getting the ones I know I already love! Oh, and you must try the banoffee pie! I'm not a sweets or dessert person, but oh my, it is to die for!",

There were four of us, with two little saucepan lids. Good music playing, skater feel, bench seats, all in all a good vibe.

I've had a hankering for a pasty for quite some time and thought I'd have to wait until my next trip to the upper Midwest. \n\nFor starters, I like the menu here. Places that do one thing and do it well rate highly with me, and this place does pasties. There are about a dozen different kinds of pasties on the menu ranging from traditional (beef & potatoes or chicken pot pie) to unusual (salmon or Mexican), for example. The pasties are pre-made and warmed up to order and come with sauces. The red wine gravy I tried was very good. There are a few side dishes like chips, slaw, and beans, and some good looking desserts. (I can't say how they tasted; I had a second Strongbow for dessert.) They have several beers on draft and some bottles, too. \n\nI thought the portion size was decent, but certainly not huge, and the prices fair, especially considering the next nearest pasty place is probably hundreds or thousands of miles away (aside from the CPC's other location, obviously). The pasty seemed authentic and pretty consistent with what I grew up with, but it was a bit salty and a bit dry, though the gravy helped. The flavors were good, though, and I enjoyed my Oggie (their main beef pasty). \n\nThe place is small, dark, and divey. There's a single row of tables mostly two-tops along one wall and about a dozen seats at the bar. Dark clothes, visible body piercings, and tattoos seem to be a prerequisite for employment at this place. I got the sense that this place turned into a heavy-metal bar in the evenings, though I could be wrong. I certainly enjoyed the Queen playing when I got there, and the two guys that waited on me at the bar were friendly, cool guys, and the service was efficient. \n\nThis is a place I'll visit whenever I'm in town. There's just nothing like it outside of England and the upper Midwest.",

MMMM the food came out nice and warm.\n\nI have to be honest that I liked the mans more than mine, his dish was a little spicy and it came with this chipotle style spread that pulled all the flavors together. The porky was good, it reminded me of pub food I have had in Edinburg, Scotland. It was gravy filled with lots of potatoes and meat.  Needless to say, I felt like I needed a nap afterwards; however, we decided to share the PB&J desert and it was GREAT!  Hands down the warmest best PB&J I have ever had.

Two of us got soft drinks (soda + root beer), and they were FLAT. As in nary a bubble to be seen flat.  We told the waitress, and it was about 10 minutes later with some fresh bubbly sodas.\n\nDid I mention they were out of a ton of things? We eventually ended up with potato wedges (out of the fries), lamb pasty, thanksgiving pasty, leak + potato soup, and english toffee pudding. Why do establishments think it's cute to rename products which already have a perfectly acceptable name (I'm looking at you, starbucks)? \n\nBefore the food could come out, they seated a party of 7 LARGE individuals at our communal bench. We are a party of 4 normal to slender individuals, but the amount of human flesh pushed up to us was ridiculous.  There's personal space, and then there's hello, you are practically in my lap! Seriously, their party should have gotten a whole communal table to themselves because it was absurd.\n\nFood came - it was hot, and everyone seemed happy.

Fresh broccoli and cauliflower topped with a creamy cheese mixture and baked HOT. Their NEW soup...OMG...its a, shit cant remember its name, like a jalapeno red pepper corn something spicy hot soup. Its awesome! Only get a cup though, cuz you need to save room for their pasty. \n\nI actually have a take out menu in my car, i am slowly crossing off everything i try. They have a large variety, so any mixture you may enjoy, they have. Take some time with the menu. \n\nDesserts usually never have room for them...",

Upon entering this BAR/restaurant I was immediately turned off by the blasting of music so loud my heart was pounding. After ordering and waiting on our drinks I had decided to just leave because of the music but was presently surprised that after asking the waitresses to turn the music down, she did with a smile. I guess they prefer a total BAR atmosphere ! After surveying the menu for 15 minutes I decided on the Philly Cheese Steak Pastie and my friend went traditional with the Shepherds Pie.\nLet me say we were NOT disappointed, the Pasties were fresh and yummy delicious, mine came with a mustard cream sauce as well as their red wine gravy that I had asked for. I prefer the gravy ! My friends Shepherds Pie with Lamb and the wine gravy was also yummy. After a short walk around I was surprised to see all of these wonderful pie's were being made FRESH behind a short order/bar environment. Yes just like we used to see in the drug stores, a griddle and gas fired 4 burner stove and a tiny convection oven If you've never had a pastie, its basically like a calzone but uses a pastry crust. There were over 25 different variations with several great looking desserts, we decided on the homemade bread pudding, more chocolate brownie tasting then traditional bread pudding, but tasty all the same.\nThere prices were fair for the Tempe area, $9.50 and $9.75 respectively and the bread pudding was $7.50.\nI am looking forward to dining there again when they are not out of their homemade sausage.\nIf you don't care for a Bar atmosphere, loud music, dark and dingy then you should steer clear or set outside.\nI should add that I found it extremely odd that they used old church pews for a large part of their seating.",

Give me a few weeks, I bet I can make that happen.\n\nI stopped in here on Sunday for lunch about 1pm. We walked in to this small, narrow... PACKED bar. Misconception #1, it never occurred to me that we might not be able to get a table!! There was one very large rectangular table near the back, and thankfully the trio seated on just one side of the huge table, graciously allowed my party of two to take the other side. Whew.\n\nI ordered a beer (The waitress even recommended one that wasn't on the menu yet, nice touch) and my sister, who is much better behaved than I am, ordered a water. I ordered the chicken tikka masala pasty (I'm sure it's not really traditional but I have a thing for indian food at the moment) and my  sister got the Chicken Greek. \n\nAnd we waited... and waited. OK, Misconception #2  :) I mistakenly thought this would be sort of a fast-food place.  It wasn't! It was about a 40 minute wait for the food. And I am NOT complaining... I'm just saying... I had a misconception! It was SO GOOD I'd have waited double the time (although I'd be drunk by that time, considering what a good beer selection they  have, no good would come from that!). Incidentally, the service was quite good and responsive, especially considering how busy they were. \n\nMy chicken tikka masala was very flavorful, but only slightly spicy (The waitress told me they make their curry in-house, I assume they make it only mildly spicy to accommodate all diners), I was impressed. My only complaint is that the potatoes inside my tikka masala pasty were still quite firm... but that's probably a matter of personal preference. I like potatoes well done, not still firm. My sister was very happy with her Chicken Greek and she's such a picky eater (I love you Julie!) that it's a damn miracle she liked it that much. \n\nOh, and our bill was like $22.00. Awesome, I can afford to come here all the time!! We will certainly be back, I look forward to being able to upgrade this place to 5 stars.",

Others would probably like it, but at 1pm, I want there to be a little bit of light in a building so I can see what I'm eating, others at the table, etc. \n\nThe pasty was \"ok\" in my opinion. The pastry itself is flaky and was pretty good. It seemed though that the filling varied at the table --depending on what you order, you may get something dry. I ended up getting a pasty that was supposed to be filled with spicy chicken and green chile but the chicken wasn't that spicy. The chile was just \"ok\" considering that we're in the southwest. \n\nDrinks seemed expensive (and I'm talking about sodas here) and they charge for refills?

Came to this location to tonight for the first time in probably a year or two and the service was so awful I felt the need to share.  I hate to do it, because the food really is good and they have a solid beer selection and decent prices, but this was the worst service I can remember in 15+ years of eating out.  Service here has never been great, but this was the worst I have seen it and compared to most other places around Tempe that have excellent service it was pretty abysmal.\n\nIt was only slightly busy when we got there, most tables were taken but usually only 1-2 people at a 4-8 person table.  We had a mediums sized group, 7 or 8, and were able to find a table outside.  Took probably 15-20 minutes before anyone came by.  The table hadn't been cleared from the people before us so fortunately there was already a beer menu there. Server did not clear or wipe down the table at all, just asked for our order. The menu has like 5-6 rotating beers, asked our server what they were. Rather than just tell us what the 5-6 were, he made us ask individually (they are categorized, seasonal,IPA, etc.).  He ended up having to list off almost all of them anyway (we ordered 3-4 of them), and this was the first indication that things would be difficult.  \n\nDrinks and food came out relatively quick.  No real issues here but only half of us were eating.  Server was not terrible friendly or helpful.  Acted annoyed when answering questions or having to wait at all.  Everything was bare minimum effort and it wasn't because it was busy.\n\nThe big problem came when the check came.  First, they pretty much ran us off.  No one asked for the check, it was 9:30 at a place that closes at 12, and the place was basically empty, but he just dumped the check without saying anything.  Put everything on one check, when the group was clearly individuals, and then pretty much refused to split it (3 different people asked).   Told us we could tell him amounts and he would charge them.   He had charged us for one item we ordered but they didn't have, I let him know and he said he would remove.  We do the math, give him cards and checks, and he brings it back.  Tells us pretty rudely we are $6-$7 short.  5 of that was his failure to remove the $5 item he billed us for and had just said he would remove.  I let him know that I am not happy that a) he billed us for an item we didn't get in the first place and b) had to ask him twice to remove.  Rather than just apologize, he gives me grief \"Whoa Buddy, nothing to get mad about\".  At this point it had probably taken 15 minutes just to take care of the check and everyone at my table was pretty annoyed.  No one had ever had this much difficulty with a check and he honestly would have saved himself a lot of work and hassle had he just split it from the beginning and not fought us about it every step of the way.\n\nWould generally recommend the Pasty, but will avoid this location like plague from now on.  Been coming here since the location was essentially a hallway, but will not anymore.  Head to the Mesa location instead.",

I've had a hankering for a pasty for quite some time and thought I'd have to wait until my next trip to the upper Midwest. \n\nFor starters, I like the menu here. Places that do one thing and do it well rate highly with me, and this place does pasties. There are about a dozen different kinds of pasties on the menu ranging from traditional (beef & potatoes or chicken pot pie) to unusual (salmon or Mexican), for example. The pasties are pre-made and warmed up to order and come with sauces. The red wine gravy I tried was very good. There are a few side dishes like chips, slaw, and beans, and some good looking desserts. (I can't say how they tasted; I had a second Strongbow for dessert.) They have several beers on draft and some bottles, too. \n\nI thought the portion size was decent, but certainly not huge, and the prices fair, especially considering the next nearest pasty place is probably hundreds or thousands of miles away (aside from the CPC's other location, obviously). The pasty seemed authentic and pretty consistent with what I grew up with, but it was a bit salty and a bit dry, though the gravy helped. The flavors were good, though, and I enjoyed my Oggie (their main beef pasty). \n\nThe place is small, dark, and divey. There's a single row of tables mostly two-tops along one wall and about a dozen seats at the bar. Dark clothes, visible body piercings, and tattoos seem to be a prerequisite for employment at this place. I got the sense that this place turned into a heavy-metal bar in the evenings, though I could be wrong. I certainly enjoyed the Queen playing when I got there, and the two guys that waited on me at the bar were friendly, cool guys, and the service was efficient. \n\nThis is a place I'll visit whenever I'm in town. There's just nothing like it outside of England and the upper Midwest.",

Being that it's been a while, I decided to try it again with a friend who loves it. It is a loud, dark restaurant with the window shades down and minimal lighting, so we opted to sit outside since it was a nice day. Plenty of seating available and our server came out within a few minutes with some menus and our drink orders. I got the veggie chicken tikka masala pasty from their wonderful vegetarian section and my friend ordered the chicken Greek, her favorite. I was pleasantly surprised with my pasty, I loved the Indian spices and the flavors worked together well. The portion size was just enough that I was able to finish it and be full. They use Quorn for their veggie chicken and it's got a weird texture but mixed with other ingredients in a pasty, it works. \n\nLots to choose from here, veggie and meat lovers alike. There's locations in Mesa and Scottsdale as well, with one set to open in Downtown Phoenix sometime. Check them out! You're bound to find something you like.",

It is in an old run down building that looks pretty bad from the outside, but has a lot of character and is interesting once inside. Don't let the appearance stop you from eating here though, the food is quite good.  If you don't know, a pasty is a bit like a cross between a pot-pie and calzone.  They have amazing combinations of meats, veggies, and spices so that everyone will enjoy something (if like pot-pie type foods in the first place).  One time, we called ahead and ordered food while driving to the restaurant.  When we got there, we were seated and food was on the table in under 2 minutes.  It was amazing.",

This is a dark restaurant, one that puts you in the kitchen. Literally. If you find yourself disturbed by seeing real kitchen professionals running around, then avoid this place. \n\nWalking in, I felt like I was going into a dive bar. All of the kitchen staff is motley, and I loved it. We took two seats at the bar, and were greeted by an awesome server. She got us Guinness (poured perfectly, that gets a star), and we got to check out the menu.\n\nVast, is a good phrase for this menu. If you haven't had a Pasty before, I like to think of it as a Hot Pocket that doesn't make you want to die.  I got the Cottage Pie Pasty, and my friend got the Italian Pasty. \n\nOur pasties were served on very distinct metal plates, with a sauce side. I had a red wine gravy, which was incredible. Tart and not thick at all. It was excellent. My friend had a marinara, he replied that it had a nice spice to it.\n\nThe food was excellent. My Pasty was filled with ground beef, potatoes, peas ,carrots, and cheese.  Warm, gooey, and it felt good being in there.\n\nThat is what I would say is the key to this place. You have to love it. You have to love feeling of the warmth every time the oven is opened, along with the following scent of roasted herbs and spices. The staff, rushing around, looking more like roadies than cooking professionals.\n\nThis place is real. It's alive. And it's good. Check out the menu, and go there. I will be going as much as possible.",

I still call over to that location to see if anyone there wants to give me an excuse to make the drive across town to meet for a Black Velvet. Hello, my name is Kara... and I'm an unabashed alcoholic.  \n\nSo if you're following along, when we meet at Pasty Co, I'll already be full from a Sack's sandwich-- but as soon as I smell the baking dough & simmering spices, I'll be perusing the amply stocked vegetarian section of the menu and trying to decide between my three favorites-- The Mexican, The Rosemary Chicken, and the Tikka Masala.  And man alive, you can't drink at a place that's got such a great pub-style atmosphere and not have a great pub-style ale of which they have many.  That's my only complaint about this place-- I am compelled to eat hearty, drink hearty, and be merry until I about burst at the seams.  \n\nManaging a kitchen myself, I'm continuously amazed at what they can do with what little space they have!  Their seating area is only a bit longer and wider than their kitchen/prep area which is open to ogle and runs parallel to the grubbing area.  I enjoy sitting at the bar to spy on the process and trying to catch the staff eavesdropping on our loud bar banter.  I love when someone mashing potatoes chuckles at our drunken philosophy sessions.  \n\nParting Tip: As mentioned in other reviews, and their claim to fame (rightly so)-- $3 Irish Car Bombs! (I've seen places charge $6!!!). Oh, and don't forget the Banoffee Pie for dessert.  They make their own whip cream!",

First off, the place has an hole-in-the-wall feel to it, definitely a cool Blue Collar working Pub atmosphere that seemed unique and not kitschy.  The menu has so many delicious options too...plenty of meat filled pockets for me and Veggie options for her and each meal is definitely filling.  I had never had a Cornish Pastry before and the little bit of British history on the menu added to the experience.  The Pastries are pretty much like giant Hot Pockets...but giant hot pockets like your grandma would make if she made giant hot pockets..IE: delicious, filling, natural, and did I say delicious? stuffed with all kinds of meat, veggies, mashed potatoes, spices, etc.  Definitely try it!",

Though the pasty menu is extensive and creative with lots of veggie options too.  It was fantastic!  Succulent steak chunks and vegetables wrapped up in the delicious pastry crust. Very authentic!  Also had the mushy peas, true British chippy style. \n\nFor dessert I had to have the sticky toffee pudding as that's my all time favourite 'afters' from home. It arrived in its own black cauldron with a side of creme anglaise. Absolutely amazing! The sweet gooey toffee inside was perfectly warm and runny.

I have not had another vegan pasty, decided that they do the others so good that I will indulge in the heavier tastier options instead!

We always leave soo full and need a nap usually right when we get home but we always feel so satisfied. It's turned into the spot my friends and I go to together and we have even done the take-home ones at some small get-togethers we've had!

I like that cuz some menus need to be revamped. So many choices, but I narrowed it down to four pastries quickly based on what I prefer. The Porky, Italian, All Day English Breakfast and the Lamb & Mint. I opted for the latter and overall was happy with my selection (one of my friends also went for this one and she liked it). \n\nFood:\nCame out warm and smelling delicious (of course I had to snap it first). I wanted to try it without the sauce and it was good, but not tasty. Adding the Red Wine Gravy made it very tasty so it makes sense there's not too much flavor before adding it (ate 1/2 with this gravy). My other friend was having one of the steak ones and his came with Peppercorn Brandy Cream Sauce so I asked for a side for my second half. Sooooo good! I did try a bite of the blue cheese steak pastry he had and very tasty to me, but you must love blue cheese if ordering that one FYI otherwise they said it's too overbearing (perfect for me and blue cheese lovers tho). \n\nRestroom: \nNot very pretty in there, but I wouldn't expect it to be in a hipster dive type bar. The stalls were not painted by an artist, lol, but the bright color choice was a good try. I hope all the graffiti was written when there wasn't a line since there's only two stalls. I'm thinking AZ doesn't have the law enforcing toilet seat covers. They had toilet paper, soap, working toilets (oh wait one out of the two was out of order), and running water...so that's really all that matters I suppose. The owner had a sweet long note pulled from Facebook on the wall (it was thanking the community/customers for their continued support) and I would have taken a pic, but left my phone back at the booth. \n\nOverall it was a good experience so I tipped well and didn't have leftovers.",

This place is great!\n\nIt's kind of a British pub atmosphere inside. Really laid back and comfortable - and mostly men dining... my party balanced it out as the three of us brought some estrogen inside!  The menu consists of a diverse variety of pasties, which are like calzones or English hot pockets.  They are all homemade with fresh ingredients, and many of them sound super yummy; i had a hard time deciding what to order... \n\nI went with the chicken greek pasty while my dining companions went with the carne adovada and the spicy asiago chicken.  I think we were all pretty happy with our respective orders.  I noticed they have large salads on the menu also.  I'm thinking perhaps next visit I'll try a salad - maybe even go with someone who has similar tastes to me and split a pasty and a salad?  Any takers?\n\nEither way, I'll be back - it may have been my first Cornish Pasty experience but it will not be my last!",

Compared to my hunger, this thing looked puny.  But the smell, the steam, and crispiness of the pastry itself were just too good to be disappointed.

The mood lighting really helps secure this. I was a little nervous at first since I didn't see any lights on outside but was instantly reassured after entering. \n\nThe staff here are quite friendly! Evident by the crowd they attract in addition to the recommendations they offer. \nOne funny observation was how the people sitting in the slightly elevated area all seemed to be on dates. How fitting. \n\nAmbience is small potatoes in comparison to the food though. The pasties here are BRIMMING with flavor. As the cross sections of the food show, there is no room for air pockets. Each pasty is absolutely stuffed with your selected filling. As a bonus, they look gorgeous. The cross sections are super colorful and the part where the pasty is folded and pressed looks like it's been woven like a basket. One other thing I like about this place is how you're given a small cup of sauce or gravy to dip your pasty in. While my chicken pot pie pasty was no where near being dry, I loved having this extra gravy at my disposal. (You can never have too much gravy) \n\nOverrall, I'm really excited about this place. I'll be sure to return with ample hunger. It can be very difficult to perfectly describe a flavor in its entirety so definitely try this place out for yourself.",

            "text": "I am reviewing the original Tempe location.  Given all the great reviews this place has gotten, I was wondering what I could add that hasn't already been said.  It's not only the only place in Tempe you can get a cornish pasty, but they are also freak'n awesome.  The Lovely Bit of Salmon was my favorite, but alas given my newly discovered gluten intolerance I am not able to part-take in such loveliness any more:  :(\n\nBut nevertheless, I still come here every now and then with my friends and husband.  They all chow down on the yummy pasties while I chow down on my salads, sides, and soups.  So, I decided to concentrate my review on those items. (Some of these dishes are not gluten free.  I had them before I found out about my gluten intolerance.) \n\nSoups:\nThey offer a variety of soups.  I have tried: 1) the cream of leek, potato, and stilton, 2) the cream of tomato and crouton, and 3) the red pepper, black bean, rice, chicken, and jalapeno.  They were all very good, but I was informed that only the red pepper one is gluten free.  I had the first two before I found out about my gluten intolerance.  Not only are their soups really tasty, full of flavor, they are all also accompanied by thick slices of fresh bread and butter, baked and churned in-house.  Absolutely delicious!  The are perfect accompaniments, and a bowl at $4.75 would make a tasty and light lunch that won't break the bank.  \n\nSides: \nThe garlic mashed potatoes and the garlic roasted potatoes are also very good.  Pretty much what you should expect.  Creamy mashed potatoes and nicely roasted red potatoes with a hint of garlic.  Not too garlicky.  \n\nThe mushy peas is one of my favorite side dishes that they serve.  I think I prefer them to the potatoes simply because they are something different that I can't get anywhere else.  And these ain't  no ordinary peas.  They are huge for peas.  Cooked really well.  Not too mushy (overcooked), even though they are \"mushy\" peas. There is a great texture and freshness to this dish.  The texture of these \"mushy peas\" is more like crunchy peanut butter than creamy peanut butter if we were speaking of peanut butter that is (it's an analogy. . . just go with it), and I think the freshness and the texture go hand in hand from not overcooking the peas.  \n\nThe broccoli and cauliflower cheese bake is also a nice dish.  It makes me think of mac'n cheese, but with cauliflower and broccoli instead of mac noodles.  I dont think this dish is gluten free.  It seems to be made with a cheese sauce that is thickened with a flour rue, then baked to give a nice golden, crusted top.  It was tasty as well, but could have used a bit more seasoning.  It was my least favorite of all the sides I have had. \n\nAll their salads are also pretty good.  The veggies in the salad are pretty much the same regardless of which salad you get: ice berg lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and onions.  Except for the Greek and pasta.  The Greek has feta and olives, and the pasta has a whole list of its own ingredients.  \n\nWhat differentiates the various salads are the additions and the dressing.  Beside the basic garden and Greek, the three other salads to choose from are: 1) the salmon or chicken caesar, 2) the chicken tikka salad, and 3) the sausage salad.  The salmon caesar is a great substitute for the Lovely Bit of Salmon pasty.  The salmon is cooked very well.  Juicy, not overcooked and not undercooked, seasoned just like the salmon in the Lovely Bit of Salmon.  Ask for a side of the white wine and dill dressing that usually accompanies the Lovely Bit of Salmon and you will not regret it.  That sauce is amazing.  This is my favorite salad. The chicken tikka is also good.  The chicken is marinated in a red rub or spice, like what you would find with tandoori chicken, and served on a salad with yogurt dressing.  Finally, the sausage salad was not my favorite.  They make the sausage in house, but I was a bit disappointed with the flavor and the way it was cooked.  It was overcooked, very dry, and a bit off.  I'm not sure if I would order it again.  I've had it twice and it was the same both times.\n\nOverall, this is one of the best restaurants in Tempe!",

            "text": "A modern take on a British staple, Cornish Pasty Company has about 50 different pasties to choose from including at least 10 vegetarian pasties and even some dessert pasties too! \n\nThe restaurant has a Brit pub feel to it, with a bar bar on one side and a dining area and counter seating on the other. \n\nCornish Pasties were a working class food for miners. They were crimped at one end so that the miners with the soiled hands could eat them and just throw out the end they were holding. Here the pasties range from $9-$11 each and the pictures on Yelp can be deceiving. You may think they look like a empanada but in real life they are the size of calzone, they are large. \n\nMushroom, Walnut, Spinach Soup - I'm a big cream of mushroom fan so I had to try this out. I ordered a full bowl but they only brought me out a cup of it. I asked if it was a mistake and they said they were out of the soup for the night so they gave me the smaller cup for free! After one sip I was wishing there was a bowl of it, because it was that good. Creamy mushroom without overdoing it on the cream, pureed spinach and walnuts with a walnut chunk in almost every bite. Served with warm sourdough bread. One of the best versions of mushroom soup that I have ever had.\n\nLamb & Mint Pasty (Lamb, Potatoes, Rutabaga, Onion, Fresh Mint) - My friends got this and I tried a bite. It was good, not gamey at all and paired well with the red wine gravy. Recommended. \n\nPeppered Steak Pasty (Sirloin Steak, Sautéed Portabella Mushrooms, Leeks, Roasted Zucchini, Stilton Cheese) - My server recommended this and it was all good until I forgot that it had Stilton in it. Stilton is a strong bleu cheese.  Don't get me wrong, this pasty was done very well... I would have liked it better if it didn't have Stilton in it but that was my bad for missing that on the description. If you enjoy steak and blue cheese, you will love this! Personal preference aside, this is a 5 star pasty.  It comes with a side of peppercorn brandy cream sauce which is delicious. This sauce is lightly sweet and creamy with pepper flavor but no heat and would be great with most of their pasties. If you can, ask for a side of this even if your pasty doesn't come with it. \n\nIf I make it back to Phoenix I'm going to have to try the Pilgrim (turkey, sweet potatoes and cranberry sauce), the Oogie (steak, potatoes, rutabaga), Shepard's Pie and Chicken Tikka Masala. The veggie offerings also look stupendous. \n\nThe only thing a Brit would find lacking is in their beer offerings. They do not carry too many brews from the UK. You can't get a Black and Tan or a Smithwicks here. Not a biggie, but just thought I'd mention it. \n\nUnexpected was the staff giving me the soup for free when I would have gladly paid for the smaller portion offering since I did order it. It was only a $4.50 difference, but Cornish Pasty Company went above and beyond to get it right, even when they didn't have to. \n\nNow if only they could figure out how to open other Cornish Pasty Companies across the nation (California please?)...",

The Lovely Bit of Salmon was my favorite, but alas given my newly discovered gluten intolerance I am not able to part-take in such loveliness any more:  :(\n\nBut nevertheless, I still come here every now and then with my friends and husband.  They all chow down on the yummy pasties while I chow down on my salads, sides, and soups.  So, I decided to concentrate my review on those items. (Some of these dishes are not gluten free.  I had them before I found out about my gluten intolerance.) \n\nSoups:\nThey offer a variety of soups.  I have tried: 1) the cream of leek, potato, and stilton, 2) the cream of tomato and crouton, and 3) the red pepper, black bean, rice, chicken, and jalapeno.  They were all very good, but I was informed that only the red pepper one is gluten free.  I had the first two before I found out about my gluten intolerance.  Not only are their soups really tasty, full of flavor, they are all also accompanied by thick slices of fresh bread and butter, baked and churned in-house.  Absolutely delicious!  The are perfect accompaniments, and a bowl at $4.75 would make a tasty and light lunch that won't break the bank.  \n\nSides: \nThe garlic mashed potatoes and the garlic roasted potatoes are also very good.  Pretty much what you should expect.  Creamy mashed potatoes and nicely roasted red potatoes with a hint of garlic.  Not too garlicky.  \n\nThe mushy peas is one of my favorite side dishes that they serve.  I think I prefer them to the potatoes simply because they are something different that I can't get anywhere else.  And these ain't  no ordinary peas.  They are huge for peas.  Cooked really well.  Not too mushy (overcooked), even though they are \"mushy\" peas. There is a great texture and freshness to this dish.  The texture of these \"mushy peas\" is more like crunchy peanut butter than creamy peanut butter if we were speaking of peanut butter that is (it's an analogy. . . just go with it), and I think the freshness and the texture go hand in hand from not overcooking the peas.  \n\nThe broccoli and cauliflower cheese bake is also a nice dish.  It makes me think of mac'n cheese, but with cauliflower and broccoli instead of mac noodles.  I dont think this dish is gluten free.  It seems to be made with a cheese sauce that is thickened with a flour rue, then baked to give a nice golden, crusted top.  It was tasty as well, but could have used a bit more seasoning.  It was my least favorite of all the sides I have had. \n\nAll their salads are also pretty good.  The veggies in the salad are pretty much the same regardless of which salad you get: ice berg lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and onions.  Except for the Greek and pasta.  The Greek has feta and olives, and the pasta has a whole list of its own ingredients.  \n\nWhat differentiates the various salads are the additions and the dressing.  Beside the basic garden and Greek, the three other salads to choose from are: 1) the salmon or chicken caesar, 2) the chicken tikka salad, and 3) the sausage salad.  The salmon caesar is a great substitute for the Lovely Bit of Salmon pasty.  The salmon is cooked very well.  Juicy, not overcooked and not undercooked, seasoned just like the salmon in the Lovely Bit of Salmon.  Ask for a side of the white wine and dill dressing that usually accompanies the Lovely Bit of Salmon and you will not regret it.  That sauce is amazing.  This is my favorite salad. The chicken tikka is also good.  The chicken is marinated in a red rub or spice, like what you would find with tandoori chicken, and served on a salad with yogurt dressing.  Finally, the sausage salad was not my favorite.  They make the sausage in house, but I was a bit disappointed with the flavor and the way it was cooked.  It was overcooked, very dry, and a bit off.  I'm not sure if I would order it again.  I've had it twice and it was the same both times.\n\nOverall, this is one of the best restaurants in Tempe!",

            "text": "Dating back hundreds of years, the Cornish pasty comes from humble beginnings. The half moon shaped baked pastry filled with meat and vegetables was designed as a lunch for soot-covered Cornish tin miners. To eat it, miners would hold the pasty at the crimped edge, and then discard that part after eating the rest of the pasty. This way the miners didn't eat the dirt they were covered in, missing out on ingesting stuff like arsenic that was common in the mines. While most tin mining is gone, we're fortunate to have the Cornish Pasty Co., which specializes in pasties.\n\nWith restaurants in Tempe and Mesa, each location has its own spirit. While both are laid back, the Tempe location has a more subdued feel with dim lighting and no windows. Mesa has a brighter interior with indie rock blaring over the sound system.\n\nIf you enjoy watching kitchen action, belly up to the bar at either locale for a first-hand look into the hard work that goes into making their delicious pasties.\n\nAs soon as I entered the Tempe location, the warm smell of wine gravy and fresh baked crust covered me like a blanket of mouth-watering comfort. The feeling was like going home for the holidays. I know it's a million degrees outside, but the feeling transcends the summer heat.\n\nThe first pasty I tried, The Pilgrim ($8), exemplified everything that tastes good at Thanksgiving, luscious turkey breast, sweet potatoes, stuffing and grilled onions all wrapped in a tender crust, then served with a side of cranberry sauce. After one bite, I felt like I needed to pay thanks to someone.\n\nThe Porky ($7) is filled with all that is good: pork, apples, potatoes, onions and sage and served with a side of red wine gravy. The problem with the gravy is that it's so tasty I'm not sure whether to dunk my pasty into it or drink it.\n\nNever able to resist a good burger, I decided to take a chance with the Royale with Cheese ($7.50). Ordered medium, this pasty was brimming with a juicy hamburger, French fries and cheese and served with a side of Thousand Island dressing. As the meat juices ran down my face, I couldn't help but think of the scene in Pulp Fiction where John Travolta explains to Samuel Jackson what the name of a Quarter Pounder with Cheese is in Amsterdam.\n\nThe Peanut Butter and Jelly ($5) was served piping hot. One bite of this was not going to be enough. Filled with creamy peanut butter, raspberry preserves and sliced banana, the sweet goodness oozed out after the first cut was made. The plate was expertly cleaned in mere moments.\n\nCornish Pasty Co. has a small, but great, beer selection, including one of my favorites, Kronenbourg 1664. Plus visit during their daily happy hour from 3-5pm and you'll enjoy a buck off of every pint.",

They were crimped at one end so that the miners with the soiled hands could eat them and just throw out the end they were holding. Here the pasties range from $9-$11 each and the pictures on Yelp can be deceiving. You may think they look like a empanada but in real life they are the size of calzone, they are large. \n\nMushroom, Walnut, Spinach Soup - I'm a big cream of mushroom fan so I had to try this out. I ordered a full bowl but they only brought me out a cup of it. I asked if it was a mistake and they said they were out of the soup for the night so they gave me the smaller cup for free! After one sip I was wishing there was a bowl of it, because it was that good. Creamy mushroom without overdoing it on the cream, pureed spinach and walnuts with a walnut chunk in almost every bite. Served with warm sourdough bread. One of the best versions of mushroom soup that I have ever had.\n\nLamb & Mint Pasty (Lamb, Potatoes, Rutabaga, Onion, Fresh Mint) - My friends got this and I tried a bite. It was good, not gamey at all and paired well with the red wine gravy. Recommended. \n\nPeppered Steak Pasty (Sirloin Steak, Sautéed Portabella Mushrooms, Leeks, Roasted Zucchini, Stilton Cheese) - My server recommended this and it was all good until I forgot that it had Stilton in it. Stilton is a strong bleu cheese.  Don't get me wrong, this pasty was done very well... I would have liked it better if it didn't have Stilton in it but that was my bad for missing that on the description. If you enjoy steak and blue cheese, you will love this! Personal preference aside, this is a 5 star pasty.  It comes with a side of peppercorn brandy cream sauce which is delicious. This sauce is lightly sweet and creamy with pepper flavor but no heat and would be great with most of their pasties. If you can, ask for a side of this even if your pasty doesn't come with it. \n\nIf I make it back to Phoenix I'm going to have to try the Pilgrim (turkey, sweet potatoes and cranberry sauce), the Oogie (steak, potatoes, rutabaga), Shepard's Pie and Chicken Tikka Masala. The veggie offerings also look stupendous. \n\nThe only thing a Brit would find lacking is in their beer offerings. They do not carry too many brews from the UK. You can't get a Black and Tan or a Smithwicks here. Not a biggie, but just thought I'd mention it. \n\nUnexpected was the staff giving me the soup for free when I would have gladly paid for the smaller portion offering since I did order it. It was only a $4.50 difference, but Cornish Pasty Company went above and beyond to get it right, even when they didn't have to. \n\nNow if only they could figure out how to open other Cornish Pasty Companies across the nation (California please?)...",

One of the best versions of mushroom soup that I have ever had.\n\nLamb & Mint Pasty (Lamb, Potatoes, Rutabaga, Onion, Fresh Mint) - My friends got this and I tried a bite. It was good, not gamey at all and paired well with the red wine gravy. Recommended. \n\nPeppered Steak Pasty (Sirloin Steak, Sautéed Portabella Mushrooms, Leeks, Roasted Zucchini, Stilton Cheese) - My server recommended this and it was all good until I forgot that it had Stilton in it. Stilton is a strong bleu cheese.  Don't get me wrong, this pasty was done very well... I would have liked it better if it didn't have Stilton in it but that was my bad for missing that on the description. If you enjoy steak and blue cheese, you will love this! Personal preference aside, this is a 5 star pasty.  It comes with a side of peppercorn brandy cream sauce which is delicious. This sauce is lightly sweet and creamy with pepper flavor but no heat and would be great with most of their pasties. If you can, ask for a side of this even if your pasty doesn't come with it. \n\nIf I make it back to Phoenix I'm going to have to try the Pilgrim (turkey, sweet potatoes and cranberry sauce), the Oogie (steak, potatoes, rutabaga), Shepard's Pie and Chicken Tikka Masala. The veggie offerings also look stupendous. \n\nThe only thing a Brit would find lacking is in their beer offerings. They do not carry too many brews from the UK. You can't get a Black and Tan or a Smithwicks here. Not a biggie, but just thought I'd mention it. \n\nUnexpected was the staff giving me the soup for free when I would have gladly paid for the smaller portion offering since I did order it. It was only a $4.50 difference, but Cornish Pasty Company went above and beyond to get it right, even when they didn't have to. \n\nNow if only they could figure out how to open other Cornish Pasty Companies across the nation (California please?)...",

My husband's tried four or five different pasties and loved them all. \n\nWe've even gotten them to go, and they're still great.

My personal favorite is the chicken rosemary, with a side of HP sauce. Oven chips are a good appetizer, since it'll be about 30-40 minutes before you get your food. Awesome selection of import beers. Service is good, even when busy. Only downside is that they feel a bit overpriced, considering how much side dishes cost and no combos are available. For two people ordering pasties, 2 beers, and two sides, expect to pay around forty or fifty after a tip and tax. That said, you'll leave full!",

Imagine the best day-after-Thanksgiving sandwich you have ever tasted and you would have The Pilgrim. It came with a side of whole cranberry sauce and light gravy to smother all over the yumminess.

            "text": "Dating back hundreds of years, the Cornish pasty comes from humble beginnings. The half moon shaped baked pastry filled with meat and vegetables was designed as a lunch for soot-covered Cornish tin miners. To eat it, miners would hold the pasty at the crimped edge, and then discard that part after eating the rest of the pasty. This way the miners didn't eat the dirt they were covered in, missing out on ingesting stuff like arsenic that was common in the mines. While most tin mining is gone, we're fortunate to have the Cornish Pasty Co., which specializes in pasties.\n\nWith restaurants in Tempe and Mesa, each location has its own spirit. While both are laid back, the Tempe location has a more subdued feel with dim lighting and no windows. Mesa has a brighter interior with indie rock blaring over the sound system.\n\nIf you enjoy watching kitchen action, belly up to the bar at either locale for a first-hand look into the hard work that goes into making their delicious pasties.\n\nAs soon as I entered the Tempe location, the warm smell of wine gravy and fresh baked crust covered me like a blanket of mouth-watering comfort. The feeling was like going home for the holidays. I know it's a million degrees outside, but the feeling transcends the summer heat.\n\nThe first pasty I tried, The Pilgrim ($8), exemplified everything that tastes good at Thanksgiving, luscious turkey breast, sweet potatoes, stuffing and grilled onions all wrapped in a tender crust, then served with a side of cranberry sauce. After one bite, I felt like I needed to pay thanks to someone.\n\nThe Porky ($7) is filled with all that is good: pork, apples, potatoes, onions and sage and served with a side of red wine gravy. The problem with the gravy is that it's so tasty I'm not sure whether to dunk my pasty into it or drink it.\n\nNever able to resist a good burger, I decided to take a chance with the Royale with Cheese ($7.50). Ordered medium, this pasty was brimming with a juicy hamburger, French fries and cheese and served with a side of Thousand Island dressing. As the meat juices ran down my face, I couldn't help but think of the scene in Pulp Fiction where John Travolta explains to Samuel Jackson what the name of a Quarter Pounder with Cheese is in Amsterdam.\n\nThe Peanut Butter and Jelly ($5) was served piping hot. One bite of this was not going to be enough. Filled with creamy peanut butter, raspberry preserves and sliced banana, the sweet goodness oozed out after the first cut was made. The plate was expertly cleaned in mere moments.\n\nCornish Pasty Co. has a small, but great, beer selection, including one of my favorites, Kronenbourg 1664. Plus visit during their daily happy hour from 3-5pm and you'll enjoy a buck off of every pint.",

So for value, quality and portions this is probably among your best bets in Tempe.\n\nPunk rock and British pub grub are predictable and go together like PB&J, but Cornish Pasty is probably one of the more distinctive restaurants in the Valley for its niche of pasties in a quick service restaurant/diner setting.\n\nMy buddy was in town visiting and staying in Tempe wanted something unique for the area.  Given that he's used to Mexican, I opted for Cornish Pasty since it was nearby.\n\nMy friend couldn't finish his Oggie, with steak, potato, onion & rutabaga, but I couldn't resist polishing off the Cajun, blackened chicken breast, bacon, ham and swiss, served with an addictive side of chipotle sauce.  Spicy, but not overwhelming, but a bit on the greasy side as a warning. \n\nThe beer selection here is admirable, and had we not had to go back to work for the man that day, we would have certainly indulged.  Kronenbourg, Boddington's and Strongbow on tap, plus your expected hipster brews available by the bottle: Chimay and Rogue among them. The setting looks diner-ish with its long narrow strip mall set-up and open kitchen.  The atmosphere here is dark and weathered, but not dumpy.  \n\nThe difficulty here is deciding on a pasty.  I could have easily gone for a meat and cheese, a Mexican pasty, or chicken tikka masala. Luckily, our server was very knowledgeable about the different pasties as we couldn't make up our mind, so his recommendations were well taken.",

Sometimes it gets very busy, and the service can be slow, but the food is great.  If you do takeout, I would suggest getting the pasty once-baked (IE not cooked through).  They seem to batch prep, then finish cooking to order.. if you order once-baked, you can finish it off in your oven at your discretion, which can be better.\n\nThey tend to have British punk music about 3-4 days a week, never really payed attention to which days are which for music.  The atmosphere is okay, but I prefer the feel of the Scottsdale and Mesa locations, this one is just the closest to me.\n\nSome of my favorites include the Potato Leak Soup (best I've had anywhere), and the following pasties... The Mexican (vegetarian version is good too), Lamb Vindaloo (it's a little spicy), and the Carne Adovada.... I've haven't had anything that was outright bad, but the Royal had way more onion than I care for, and I also didn't care for The Italian either which was way too close to a calzone, but the difference in a pasty crust wasn't my taste.\n\nAll said, pretty much everyone can find something to like here... fair warning, it is definitely not a carb friendly menu.. there are a few salads which are good, but it's not their mainstay.",

We sat outside and even though it was May they had the heaters on because it was chilly. Very considerate for us true Arizonans.

When I cut myself shaving, I bleed red wine gravy.\n\nI frequent CPC more than I should.  Guilty as charged.  The food is just...so damn good.  I'm also a fan of their dfraft beer selection.  32oz mugs of Hoegaarden or Dead Guy ale?  Yes, please.\n\nI've turned many people on to the wonders of this place.  Out of all of my friends that tried it, the only one that didn't fully appreciate it was the one that had a lap band.  I don't recommend this place if your stomach is the size of a walnut because there will be some damage.\n\nI've tried nearly all of the pasties (with the exception of the vegetarian ones) and it's difficult to pick a favorite.  I guess if I had to narrow it down to three, I'd choose (in no particular order), the Oggie, the chicken greek and the pilgrim.  Damn delectable!\n\nI've also had their pasta salad.  It's huge.  I probably wouldn't get it again, though.  Why would I get that when I could have a pasty?  I thought I knew what comfort food was until I had my first pasty.\n\nOK, so what about the interior?  There isn't much of it!  It's a hole in the wall.  The Mesa location is quite bigger, so if you're dead set on trying the food on a Friday or Saturday, you may want to check out the Mesa setting.\n\nI've only had to wait for a table once, and it wasn't for very long, but I tend to visit during the off hours (late afternoon or later in the evening).  If you're flying solo, don't be ashamed to hop on a bar stool and watch the 20 something hipster dudes cook up gravy and other vittles.   \n\nSpeaking of the employees, they're a motley bunch.  Service is usually pretty decent.  If you're a fan of tattoos, nearly all of the employees are inked.  It definitely lends a sense of style to the place.  \n\nThere's a single unisex bathroom in the back.  If you gotta go, you gotta go.  I suggest forming a line if it's in use because I've seen people treat it like an airplane bathroom: they'll keep looking over their shoulder to see if the person inside has left and then get up, only to be cut off at the pass by someone seated closer doing the same bit.\n\nI've only had one bad pasty experience.  My pasty was slightly over-baked.  I think the guy that baked it was over-baked, too.  Look at the eyes of some of the cooks.  They're redder than the gravy!\n\nAt any rate, that one pasty doesn't warrant the loss of a star compared to the dozens of other perfect pasties that I've had.  I recommend this place to everyone.  Leave your diet in your car and enjoy yourself.",

            "text": "Reasons Why I Love CPC: \nGREAT FOOD\nGREAT PRICES\nGREAT ATMOSPHERE\nNICE STAFF\nDELIVERY!!\n \nI had never tasted the glory that is a pasty until I went there by recommendation of a friend a few years ago. Ever since my first visit, I have been hooked. I have learned to order one pasty for lunch, and get another to-go for later-- because knowing me, I will have a second craving during the day.\n\n  The first time I went I courageously tried their Chicken Tikka Masala pasty. My grandfather is from India, and I was raised on traditional Indian food, so I was a skeptic. However, their take on chicken masala (typically consisting of chicken, red curry, potatoes, vegetables and accompanied with rice) was impressive. There was just the right amount of curry to chicken to vegetable ratio, and I could not help but want to scarf it down. It was mild, so anyone could love it. Even their Vegetarian Tikka Masala pasty is delicious. As a former vegetarian and vegan, I am always skeptical when trying new meat substitutes, but the Quorn chicken substitute has a great consistency. \n \nAnother time I went, I tried their Shepherd's Pie Pasty, and declared that a victory. The pastry shell was crisp, the filling was flavorful, and the peas and carrots hadn't gone to mush. You can tell that they make the pasties (pastys?) fresh just by biting into them, but if you're not convinced, sit up at the bar and watch. \n\n  I will say, one of the best pasties they have is their Lovely Bit a Salmon. It took me a while to be able to order it because every time I tried, they were sold out (AND FOR GOOD REASONING!). I got lucky one unassuming Tuesday afternoon while ordering delivery for my mother, my roommate and myself. They were surprisingly prompt in their delivery and didn't seem to get lost with my crappy directions to my apartment. I ordered the Salmon, my mother the Pilgrim (SOOOO GOOD), and my roommate the Cheese Steak ( I didn't try his, but he said it was awesome). The Salmon pasty was heaven. I am not kidding- HEAVEN wrapped in a delicate pastry blanket and hand delivered from The Almighty Himself. The salmon was cooked to perfection, the dill sauce was mild, the asparagus still al dente, the potatoes were perfect, and the tomatoes and spinach were an added plus. \n\n My new favorite \"every-now-and-again\" pasty is The Peanut Butter and Jelly. HOLY GUACAMOLE! They have taken the traditional PB&J and slapped it in the face sent it home to it's momma. Then added some refinement, and some ooey-gooey, yummy in my tummy, goody-goody gumdrops to it. Holy Toledo. The banana is welcomed added bonus.  \n \nTo be honest, I have yet to try a pasty there that I do not like. This is a great thing, yet can be very unhelpful when trying to figure out what to have for lunch or dinner. \n\n Maybe someone can help me... I do not know what is in their salad dressing for their basic green salad... but it is AMAZING! \n Their garlic roasted potatoes and mushy peas are so yummy as well. \n\n They have my two drink requirements on tap: Guinness and Boddingtons. Also, they have Duvel which is one of my favorite Belgian beers for a moderate price. They have great Happy Hour drink specials including $3 car bombs. $3! YOU CAN'T BEAT THAT!\n\n Dine in, take out, or delivery. It doesn't matter how you get it, just GET IT! Make sure that if you order their green salad you get extra dressing--you will be happy that you did.",

I was glad to see that the restaurant is doing well and remodeled their two locations with more locations coming soon. \n\nThe food at Cornish Pasty is impeccable. I always bring friends and family visiting here to try the unique cuisine. I like to explain it as 'gourmet hot pockets'. I haven't ordered a thing I didn't like. I know it can be hard for picky eaters since there are no substitutions but thankfully I don't have that problem. Their soups are amazing, all made in house. The peppered steak and chicken and rice soup are my two favorite dishes. The Mesa location recently added some new appetizers and I can't wait to try them all. Very disappointed to find that Tempe didn't add them to the menu yet. \n\nThe atmosphere, music, and excellent drink selection is another aspect I love about this place. It's good for dates as well. $5 mid shelf and always $3 Irish Car bombs with lots of microbrews on draft? YES PLEASE. \n\nThe one thing I hate about Cornish Pasty, and the reason why I give it 2/5 is the SERVICE SUCKS. It must be a requirement to be a hipster with 5+ visible tattoos/piercings with a poor work effort. You even get a raise for having poor personal hygiene! I've been eating at Cornish Pasty for 5 years and have never received good service. Last time I ate at the mesa location the service had improved a lot, unfortunately I went to Tempe a week later and had awful service. I could go into detail about the awful service, forgetting ordered items, being ignored and the general distasteful appearance of the staff. I don't mind tattoos and piercings, I have some! I was even a waitress for 7 years, but you should really brush your hair, shower, or wear socks to work.\n\nIf you like great food, drinks and atmosphere and can stand the idiots they hire to serve you. Then definitely eat here. I will continue to be a regular, I just wish their management would shape up those servers. I would recommend the Mesa location over the Tempe one. The Mesa one added new menu items, I ate there about 3 weeks ago and received great service. The Tempe one continues to disappoint. Although the food is always top notch.",

The menu offers many different kinds of pasties - steak, pork, lamb, Italian, meatball, Mexican, veggies, etc for about $10.  They also have soups, salads and sides.  This place was already busy around 5pm on a weeknight.  The place was big on the inside and very dark.  Service was friendly and fast.  There's happy hour daily between 3p-6p where you can save $1 off draft beer, wine and liquor.\n\nFour Peaks - $6 for 20oz local beer.  Light and refreshing.\nVindaloo Lamb $11 - Tasty and slightly spicy.\nOggie $9.25 - Delicious steaks and potatoes!

After having read the reviews, I decided to give it a shot once I realized that they actually do have a fairly extensive veggie-friendly menu.  Despite not being a fan of fake meat products, I decided to try the veggie asiago chicken pasty and was pleasantly surprised.  The brand of \"wheat meat\" that they use actually had good flavor and an unusually normal texture.  The pasty also contained corn, black beans, hatch chiles, stewed tomatoes, and was not overwhelmingly heaped with asiago cheese.  The salsa that was served on the side was flavorful and a nice accompaniment to the already spicy pasty.  The crust was flavorful and flaky, just like the pasties that I remember getting growing up.  The only drawback is that the place is incredibly small and between the loud music and the conversations of other customers, my ears were ringing by the time I left.  The food is certainly worthwhile, though, and I think this may become one of my regular take out spots for lunch.",

It is one of the most unique, delicious, good ol' fashion home made cooking that will leave you begging for more.  \n\nAs a small literal hole in the wall in a strip mall, you would never notice it if you didnt already know it was there.  We found this great place thanks to yelp, and decided to give it a shot.  The ambiance is fantastic; small, intimate, and classic with the painted cement floors and dark walls, it reminds me of New York back alley taverns.  \nThe first night we went was absolutely PACKED full, but we still only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table crouched cutely in the back.  Our server was personable, and after going there a few more times I can say the whole staff is spot on.  \n\nNow to the menu.  Great beer selection at great prices always adds a star for me.  But that is simply the prequel to the awesomeness that awaits you with the food.  I have had other food but the pasties here - the pasta salad is delicious, good strong greek salad too - but its useless to try to compare it to the pasties.  They have every combination imaginable, from the hearty shepards pie and the oogie to culture fusions like the cajun, the mexican, and one of my favorites, the lamb vindaloo.  You would never think that these ingredients could be packed into a puff pastry and come out incredibly delicious, but it seems to be more of a delightful delectable experience every time I go.  \n\nTheir desserts are so good too, last time getting the Banoffee pie to go, which was sinful it was so good.  One of the best perks about this place though, is that you can bring any 1/2 cooked pasty home with you - it just takes 10 minutes in the oven - and tada you have awesomeness on hand at home anytime you want.... something i definitely recommend!  Yet again, thank you yelp for a favorite of Phoenix, and if you havent been here yet, believe the hype and do yourself a favor!",
